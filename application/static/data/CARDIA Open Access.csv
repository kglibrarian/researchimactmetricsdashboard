Specifically, the long-term impact of alcohol use on ventricular remodeling or dysfunction, its modulators, and effect thresholds among young adults remain controversial. OBJECTIVES The authors sought to evaluate a potential relationship between alcohol intake and cardiac remodeling, assessed by echocardiography, over 20 years of follow-up. METHODS Among the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study cohort, the authors studied all subjects without baseline heart disorders who provided adequate information on their drinking habits and underwent echocardiographic evaluation at years 5 and 25 of the study. The echocardiographic outcomes were left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, indexed LV end-diastolic volume and LV mass, and left atrial diameter. Participants were grouped according to their weighted-average weekly drinking habits. An additional analysis used the estimated cumulative alcohol consumption. Regression models and multivariable fractional polynomials were used to evaluate the association between alcohol consumption and the outcomes. RESULTS Among the 2,368 participants, alcohol consumption was an independent predictor of higher indexed LV mass (p = 0.014) and indexed LV end-diastolic volume (p = 0.037), regardless of sex. No significant relationship between alcohol intake and LV ejection fraction was found. Drinking predominantly wine was associated with less cardiac remodeling and there was a nonsignificant trend for a harmful effect of binge drinking. CONCLUSIONS After 20 years of follow-up, alcohol intake was associated with adverse cardiac remodeling, although it was not related with LV systolic dysfunction in this initially healthy young cohort. Our results also suggest that drinking predominantly wine associates with less deleterious findings in cardiac structure. (C) 2018 the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

BACKGROUND Low CRF in midlife is associated with a higher risk of heart failure. However, the unique contributions of early-life CRF toward measures of LV structure and function in middle age are not known. METHODS CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study participants with a baseline maximal treadmill test and an echocardiogram at year 25 were included. Associations among baseline CRF, CRF change, and echocardiographic LV parameters (global longitudinal strain [GLS] and global circumferential strain, E/e') were assessed using multivariable linear regression. RESULTS The study included 3,433 participants. After adjustment for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, lower baseline CRF was significantly associated with higher LV strain (standardized parameter estimate [Std beta] = 0.06; p = 0.03 for GLS) and ratio of early transmitral flow velocity to early peak diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e') (Std = -0.10; p = 0.0001 for lateral E/e'), findings suggesting impaired contractility and elevated diastolic filling pressure in midlife. After additional adjustment for cumulative cardiovascular risk factor burden observed over the follow-up period, the association of CRF with LV strain attenuated substantially (p = 0.36), whereas the association with diastolic filling pressure remained significant (Std beta = 0.05; p = 0.02 for lateral E/e'). In a subgroup of participants with repeat CRF tests at year 20, greater decline in CRF was significantly associated with increased abnormalities in GLS (Std (3 = 0.05; p = 0.02) and higher diastolic filling pressure (Std = 0.06; p = 0.006 for lateral E/e') in middle age. CONCLUSIONS CRF in young adulthood and CRF change were associated with measures of LV systolic function and diastolic filling pressure in middle age. Low CRF-associated abnormalities in systolic function were related to the associated higher cardiovascular risk factor burden. In contrast, the inverse association between CRF and LV diastolic filling pressure was independent of cardiovascular risk factor burden.

BACKGROUND Cumulative exposure to glycemic abnormalities and trajectories of IR may adversely influence LV remodeling and function over a 25-year period in subjects who were young adults, predisposing individuals to heart failure later in life. METHODS In the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) Year 25 examination, 3,179 participants were identified with information on glucose metabolism; these participants were stratified into 4 subgroups: group 1 normal glucose tolerance (NGT), group 2 impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose, group 3 late diabetes mellitus (DM) (DM diagnosed at year 15 or later), and group 4 early DM (DM diagnosed at year 0 to year 15). Among the subgroup without DM, 3 trajectory groups of change in the homeostasis model assessment of IR were identified: low IR, moderate IR, and high IR. LV mass, relative wall thickness, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), longitudinal systolic strain (Ell), and early diastolic strain rate (Ell_SRe) at year 25 were assessed by echocardiography. Clinically relevant systolic and diastolic dysfunction were defined as LVEF <50% for systolic dysfunction, and E/e >= 13 for diastolic dysfunction. RESULTS The early DM group had less favorable LV mass (coefficient =11.04; p < 0.001), LVEF (coefficient = 2.72; p < 0.05), ELL (coefficient = 1.53; p < 0.001), and Ell_SRe (coefficient = 0.09; p < 0.05) than did the NGT group. Being in the early DM group and having high hemoglobin Al, were independently associated with greater odds of having systolic dysfunction (odds ratio = 5.44; p < 0.005) compared with the NGT group. High IR was associated with worse relative wall thickness (coefficient = 0.019; p < 0.0001) and worse Ell, E', and Ell_SRe, depending on obesity level.

Design: Data were derived from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), a longitudinal study with black and white participants from four U.S. locations. Setting: Not applicable. Patient(s): Women without miscarriages (controls) and women who miscarried at least once (cases). Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): A group of women (n = 1,372) successfully followed for 25 years and with their APOE alleles identified were analyzed for miscarriage risk throughout their reproductive life. Additionally, a larger longitudinal analysis encompassing all the participants who had their APOE characterized (n = 2,140) was also performed for the association between APOE and miscarriage risk. Result(s): In white women followed up for 25 years, the odds ratio for miscarriage associated with APOE*2 allele presence was 1.61 (950/0 confidence interval, 1.04-2.50) compared with APOE*33 carriers. This was a race-dependent phenomenon as no associations between APOE alleles and miscarriage was observed in black women. Likewise, Cox regression analysis showed that cumulative miscarriage risk in white women was 37.2% in the APOE""2 carriers compared with 27.8% and 24.8% in APOE""33 and APOE""4 carriers, respectively. With APOE*33 as the reference, the age-adjusted hazard ratio associated with carrying the APOE*2 allele was 1.47 (95 confidence interval, 1.06-2.05). Conclusion(s): This variable miscarriage risk, produced by an interaction between genotype and race, may reconcile, at least partially, the conflicting reports of the association of APOE and miscarriage risk.

OBJECTIVES This study sought to investigate how cumulative exposure to higher BP influences left ventricular (LV) function during young to middle adulthood. METHODS The CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study prospectively enrolled 5,115 healthy African Americans and whites in 1985 and 1986 (baseline). At the year 25 examination, LV function was measured by 2-dimensional echocardiography; cardiac deformation was assessed in detail by speckle-tracking echocardiography. We used cumulative exposure of BP through baseline and up to the year 25 examination (millimeters of mercury x year) to represent long-term exposure to BP levels. Linear regression and logistic regression were used to quantify the association of BP measured repeatedly through early adulthood (18 to 30 years of age) up to middle age (43 to 55 years). RESULTS Among 2,479 participants, cumulative BP measures were not related to LV ejection fraction; however, high cumulative exposure to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were associated with lower longitudinal strain rate (both p < 0.001). For diastolic function, higher cumulative exposures to SBP and DBP were associated with low early diastolic longitudinal peak strain rate. Of note, higher DBP (per SD increment) had a stronger association with diastolic dysfunction compared with SBP. CONCLUSIONS Higher cumulative exposure to BP over 25 years from young adulthood to middle age is associated with incipient LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction in middle age.

Approach and Results-At the year 20 of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a population-based multicenter cohort of young adults, women (mean age, 45 years) with information on menses and hirsutism in their twenties were assessed for CAC (n=982) and IMT (n=988). We defined PCOS as women who had both irregular menses and hyperandrogenism (n=55); isolated oligomenorrhea (n=103) as women who only had irregular menses; and isolated hyperandrogenism (n=156) as women who had either hirsutism or increased testosterone levels. Logistic regressions and general linear models were used to estimate the associations between components of PCOS and subclinical CVD. The prevalence of CAC was 10.3% overall. Women with PCOS had a multivariable adjusted odds ratio of 2.70 (95% confidence interval, 1.31-5.60) for CAC. Women with either isolated oligomenorrhea or isolated hyperandrogenism had no increased risk of CAC when compared with unexposed women.

Objectives To assess cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in active National Football League (NFL) players and to compare these findings with data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional study of 504 active, veteran football players from a convenience sample of 12 NFL teams at professional athletic training facilities between April and July 2007. Data were compared with men of the same age in the general US population (CARDIA study, a population-based observational study of 1959 participants aged 23 to 35 years recruited in 1985-1986). Main Outcome Measures Prevalence of CVD risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, and smoking). Results The NFL players were less likely to smoke when compared with the CARDIA group (0.1% [n=1]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-1.4%; vs 30.5% [n=597]; 95% CI, 28.5%-32.5%; P<.001). Despite being taller and heavier, NFL players had significantly lower prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (6.7% [n=24]; 95% CI, 4.6%-8.7%; vs 15.5% [n=267]; 95% CI, 13.8%-17.3%; P < .001). The groups did not differ in prevalence of high total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or high triglycerides. Hypertension (13.8% [n=67]; 95% CI, 11.0%-16.7%; vs 5.5% [n=108]; 95% CI, 4.6%-6.6%) and prehypertension (64.5% [n=310]; 95% CI, 58.3%-70.7%; vs 24.2% [n=473]; 95% CI, 22.3%-26.1%) were significantly more common in NFL players than in the CARDIA group ( both P<.001).

METHODS: DNA samples from 2252 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study were genotyped for the L55M and Q192R polymorphisms of the PON1 (paraoxonase 1) gene, and paraoxonase activity was measured in serum. RESULTS: The 192R (67.4% vs 29.7%) and 55L (80.0% vs 63.8%) alleles were more common in blacks vs whites. The Q192R locus was the strongest correlate of paraoxonase activity (100.4 nmol/mL/min greater in the 192RR than the 192QQ genotype). After adjustment for the Q192R locus, the L55M locus (12.7 nmol/ mL/min difference between 55LL and 55MM) and race (6.6 nmol/mL/min difference between blacks and whites) were correlated with paraoxonase activity (P <= 0.0001), as were concentrations of HDL cholesterol (23.9 nmol/mL/min difference between highest and lowest quintiles), triglycerides (12.6 nmol/mL/min difference between highest and lowest quintiles), LDL cholesterol (8.2 nmol/mL/min difference between highest and lowest quintiles), smoking status (6.3 nmol/mL/min difference between current smokers of >= 15 cigarettes/day and never smokers), and glucose concentrations at the highest quintile (6.5 nmol/mL/ min difference between highest and lowest quintiles in nondiabetic participants). There was no cross-sectional or longitudinal association between paraoxonase enzyme activity and coronary artery calcification (CAC), an early marker of cardiovascular disease, or its progression over 5 years.

Hostility scores at year 0 were unrelated to year 7 lycopene and tocopherols. In contrast, neither year 0 carotenoids nor tocopherols predicted the hostility score at year 5. High hostility predicted future low levels of some serum carotenoids, which may help to explain the association of hostility and cardiovascular risk observed in other epidemiologic studies.",10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9262,,AM J EPIDEMIOL,Am.

Methods: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ( CARDIA) study assessed coronary artery calcium (CAC) by computed tomography in young adults participating in the 15-year examination. The PDAY risk score was calculated from risk factors measured at the CARDIA examinations at years 0, 5, 10, and 15. Results: Odds ratios for amount of CAC ( 6 ordinal categories) for a 1-point increase in risk score computed from the modifiable risk factors ranged from 1.10 to 1.16 ( all statistically significant). Odds ratios for presence of any amount of CAC ranged from 1.09 to 1.15 ( all statistically significant), with the highest odds ratio for the risk score at year 0. An increase in risk score between years 0 and 15 increased the odds of CAC, and a decrease in risk score decreased the odds of CAC. A positive family history of cardiovascular disease increased the odds of CAC. The c statistics ranged from 0.752 to 0.770, with the highest discrimination based on the year 0 revised PDAY risk score that included family history and increased the points for the sex differential.

However, it is unknown whether a similar relationship exists in younger individuals. Methods: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study was initiated in 1985-1986 to determine the factors that are associated with coronary risk development in young adults. C-reactive protein concentrations were measured in 3919 African American and white men and women enrolled in CARDIA using blood specimens from the year 7 examination (1992-1993), when the age of the cohort was 25 to 37 years, and the year 15 examination (2000-2001). Results: In unadjusted analyses, CRP concentrations greater than 3 mg/L, compared with those less than 1 mg/L, was associated with a 79% greater risk of incident hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-2.28).

The present study examined the prospective association between BMI and the serum concentration of five carotenoids in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Serum carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin/lutein, lycopene), BMI, dietary intake, physical activity and dietary supplement use were measured at years 0 and 7 in 3071 black and white male and female participants, who were either persistent smokers or non-smokers. Among non-smokers, year 0 BMI predicted year 7 serum carotenoid levels: obese subjects (BMI g30 kg/m(2)) had an average concentration of the sum of four carotenoids (alpha-carotene +beta-carotene + zeaxanthin/lutein+beta-cryptoxanthin) that was 22 % lower than the concentration among subjects with a BMI of less than 22 kg/m(2). In contrast, the sum of carotenoids among smokers was only 6 % lower. Relationships between BMI and serum lycopene were weak. The change from year 0 to year 7 in serum carotenoids, except for lycopene, was inversely associated with the change in BMI among non-smokers but not among smokers. Parallel findings were observed for BMI and serum gamma-glutamyl transferase level. In summary, the observation that BMI predicted the evolution of serum carotenoids during a 7-year follow-up among young non-smoking adults is consistent with the hypothesis that carotenoids are decreased in protecting against oxidative stress generated by adipose tissue, while smokers maintain a minimal level of serum carotenoids independent of adiposity. The results for lycopene were, however, discordant from those of the other carotenoids.",59,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0007-1145,1475-2662,BRIT J NUTR,Br.

The activities of UCPs have been related to obesity and energy metabolism. Methods: We investigated the association of the commonly observed UCP2 Ala55Val (V) polymorphism with diabetes mellitus and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) among 3684 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Results: The V frequency was similar to 45% in blacks and 42% in whites. Those with the Val/Val (VV) genotype had a higher incidence of diabetes than those having the Ala/Ala (AA) genotype (5.8% vs 3.3%; P = 0.02). Similarly, the incidences of diabetes in participants without abdominal obesity were 2.8% and 1.0% (P = 0.0.3) in the VV and AA groups, and 12.4% and 8.3% (P = 0.15) in participants with abdominal obesity. The incidence of IFG was higher in VV vs AA only in those without abdominal obesity (12.9% vs 9.2%). These trends persisted in minimally and fully adjusted models, and in strata of blacks and whites and men and women. The homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance was highest in VV in the combined group of those with IFG or untreated diabetes, but not in those with normal fasting glucose.

Methods: In this prospective study, 2478 black and white men and women without microalbuminuria at year 10 provided urine samples 5 years later. Year 10 GGT cutpoints were 12, 18, and 29 U/L. Results: The incidence of microalbuminuria across year 10 GGT categories was U-shaped. Adjusted odds ratios across quartiles of serum GGT were 1.0, 0.39, 0.54, and 0.94 (P < 0.01 for quadratic term), but the shape of association depended on the status of hypertension or diabetes (P < 0.01 for interaction). Among individuals who ever had hypertension or diabetes, year 10 serum GGT showed a clear positive dose-response association with incident microalbuminuria (P < 0.01 for trend), whereas among individuals with neither hypertension nor diabetes during the study, year 10 GGT showed a U-shaped association with it (P < 0.01 for quadratic term). When the long-term risk was evaluated in 3895 participants based on serum GGT at year 0 and prevalence of microalbuminuria at year 10 or year 15, the trends were similar but weaker than those of short-term incidence risk. Conclusions: Serum GGT within the physiologic range predicted microalbuminuria among patients with hypertension or diabetes and may act as a predictor of microvascular and/or renal complications in these vulnerable groups. GGT showed a U-shaped association with microalbuminuria among persons who did not develop either hypertension or diabetes.

Coronary artery calcification (CAC), a component of coronary artery atherosclerosis, was detectable in 10% of the cohort and appeared to be in its initial stages (Agatston scores <20 in 47% and <100 in 83% of CAC-positive participants). After adjusting for sex, clinical site, age, and race, the presence of any CAC was 24% more likely among those with high vs low concentrations of F-2-isoprostanes [odds ratio (OR) = 1.24 per 92.2 pmol/L (32.7 ng/L; 1 SD of F-2-isoprostanes); 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.41].

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS- Men and women (55%) aged 18-30 years from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study without the metabolic syndrome at baseline (n = 4,192, 49% black) were followed-up from 1985 to 2001.

Metabolic syndrome risk increased with age and was higher among black participants and those with less than a high school education. Higher baseline BMI, no alcohol intake (Versus one to three drinks per day), higher intake of dietary carbohydrates, and lower intake of crude fiber were each associated with an increased risk for the metabolic syndrome (relative risk [RR] ranging from 1.3 to 1.9), and physical activity was protective (RR 0.84 [95% CI 0.76-0.92]). In models adjusting simultaneously for all factors, black participants and women were less likely to develop metabolic syndrome.

Studies suggest that people with lower (versus higher) SES during childhood subsequently have lower levels of adult pulmonary function. But prospective studies are sparse across young adulthood, an important phase in pulmonary development. Methods Participants were from the Coronary Artery (Disease) Risk Development in (Young) Adults (CARDIA) study: 5113 young adults ages 18-30 at baseline, approximately balanced within centres across gender, self-identified race/ethnicity (Black, White), and current SES. Childhood SES was ascertained from baseline self-reports of parents' highest completed education. Pulmonary function in young adulthood was measured using FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) and FVC (forced vital capacity), assessed on three occasions over a period of 5 years. Results Longitudinal analyses suggested that rates of change in both FEV1 and FVC differed in a gradient fashion by childhood SES. As shown by significant childhood SES by time interaction terms, these associations with FEV1 were robust for men (b = 1.59E-3, SE = 5.21E-4, P < 0.001) and women (b = 1.93E-3, SE = 4.80E-4, P < 0.001), and adjusted for multiple potential confounders including smoking. Results were similar for FVC. Subsequent examination of the interaction terms suggested that FEV1 and FVC declined for participants in the lowest childhood SES group, showed continued plateau or growth for those in the highest group, and were intermediate for the middle group. Conclusions Childhood SES may influence men's and women's young adult pulmonary function in two ways. First, individuals with lower childhood SES may not attain as high levels of pulmonary function in early adulthood relative to individuals with higher childhood SES. Second, pulmonary function may decline earlier and faster for individuals with lower childhood SES.",50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0300-5771,1464-3685,INT J EPIDEMIOL,Int.

Serum carotenoids and tocopherols were measured at years 0 and 7, and serum GGT was measured at years 0 and 10. Results: Circulating concentrations of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin inversely predicted the serum GGT concentration measured 10 years later in a dose-response manner (P for trend <0.01). Year 0 zeaxanthin/lutein was weakly inversely associated with year 10 GGT W for trend = 0.08), and year 0 lycopene was unrelated to year 10 GGT. Adjusted geometric means of serum GGT at year 10 according to quintile of the sum of four carotenoids at year 0 (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin/lutein) were 19.9, 19.4, 18.9, 17.8, and 17.3 U/L (P for trend <0.01). Year 0 alpha-tocopherol was also a significant inverse predictor of year 10 serum GGT concentration W for trend = 0.03), whereas gamma-tocopherol showed an inconsistent or possibly U-shaped association. However, year 0 serum GGT did not predict serum antioxidants measured 7 years later. Conclusion: Our present findings support the contention that serum GGT concentration is a marker related with oxidative stress.

Examining the inter-relation of dietary intake of fish and of polyunsaturated (n-3 and n-6) essential fatty acids with hostility may provide additional insights into the cardioprotective effect of dietary fish and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Objective: To examine the association of dietary n-3, n-6 fatty acids and fish with level of hostility in a sample of 3581 urban white and black young adults. Design: Cross-sectional observational study as part of an ongoing cohort study. A dietary assessment in 1992-1993 and measurement of hostility and other covariates in 1990-1991 were used in the analysis. Results: The multivariate odds ratios of scoring in the upper quartile of hostility (adjusting for age, sex, race, field center, educational attainment, marital status, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity) associated with one standard deviation increase in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22: 6) intake was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.82-0.98; P = 0.02). Consumption of any fish rich in n-3 fatty acids, compared to no consumption, was also independently associated with lower odds of high hostility (OR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.69-0.97; P = 0.02).

Objective To test whether low fitness, estimated by short duration on a maximal treadmill test, predicted the development of cardiovascular disease risk factors and whether improving fitness (increase in treadmill test duration between examinations) was associated with risk reduction. Design, Setting, and Participants Population-based longitudinal cohort study of men and women 18 to 30 years of age in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Participants who completed the treadmill examination according to the Balke protocol at baseline were followed up from 1985-1986 to 2000-2001. A subset of participants (n=2478) repeated the exercise test in 1992-1993. Main Outcome Measures Incident type 2 diabetes, hypertension, the metabolic syndrome (defined according to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult-Treatment Panel 111), and hypercholesterolemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol greater than or equal to160 mg/dL [4.14 mmol/L]). Results During the 15-year study period, the rates of incident diabetes, hypertension, the metabolic syndrome, and hypercholesterolemia were 2.8, 13.0, 10.2, and 11.7 per 1000 person-years, respectively. After adjustment for age, race, sex, smoking, and family history of diabetes, hypertension, or premature myocardial infarction, participants with low fitness (<20th percentile) were 3- to 6-fold more likely to develop diabetes, hypertension, and the metabolic syndrome than participants with high fitness ( >= 60th percentile), all P<.001. Adjusting for baseline body mass index diminished the strength of these associations to 2-fold (all P<.001). In contrast, the association between low fitness and hypercholesterolemia was modest (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.7; P=.02) and attenuated to marginal significance after body mass index adjustment (P=13). Improved fitness over 7 years was associated with a reduced risk of developing diabetes (HR, 0.4; 95% Cl, 0.2-1.0; P=.04) and the metabolic syndrome (HR, 0.5; 95% Cl, 0.3-0.7; P<.001), but the strength and significance of these associations was reduced after accounting for changes in weight.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Maximal exercise tests were performed by 3,295 healthy adults aged 18-30 years in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Repeat measurements of insulin and glucose collected at 7-, 10-, and 15-year examinations were compared by quartiles of HRR (maximum heart rate minus heart rate 2 min after cessation of the test). Incident diabetes was identified at any follow-up examination as glucose greater than or equal to7 mmol/l or the use of diabetes control medication. RESULTS - Among participants who did not develop diabetes, fasting insulin concentrations increased from baseline to year 15. Following adjustment (for age, race, sex, smoking status, and BMI), participants with the slowest HRR (quartile 1) had higher fasting insulin at each examination than participants with faster HRR (e.g., year 15 examination: 88.1 vs. 81.3 pmol/l for quartile I vs. quartile 4, respectively, P = 0.05). Glucose did not differ by quartile of HRR at any examination. Among participants with poor fitness, the risk of developing diabetes (n = 98) was 3.4-fold greater (95% CI 1.5-8.0) when HRR was <42 vs. >42 bpm.

Seventy percent of persons with increased albumin excretion were both normoglycemic and normotensive (systolic/diastolic blood pressure <140/90 mmHg and no use of anti hypertensive drugs). Even when diabetic subjects, who have greater risk, were excluded, albumin excretion rose continuously as blood pressure increased among Blacks; increases started at systolic/diastolic blood pressures of 130/85 mmHg among Whites.

This study sought to determine whether there is an independent association between race/ethnicity and early-onset renal impairment and to identify other risk factors that might account for observed disparities. All Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults subjects in which serum creatinine was measured at the year 15 examination were identified (n = 3554), excluding those who were pregnant at year 15, Potential risk factors at study entry (ages 18 to 30 yr, 1985 to 1986) included age, weight, gender, race/ethnicity, glucose, uric acid, and systolic BP. Renal impairment was defined as creatinine greater than or equal to1.5 mg/dl for men and greater than or equal to1.2 mg/dl for women at year 15 (ages 33 to 45 yr). Fifty-two (2.7%) women and 39 (2.4%) men had renal impairment at the year 15 examination. In bivariate analyses, the odds of renal impairment among black women was estimated to be 2.4-fold that of white women, and among black men, the odds of renal impairment were 9.0-fold that of white men. In multivariate analysis, the odds of an elevated creatinine among black women compared with white women reduced to a nonsignificant 1.5-fold, whereas among men, the odds of an elevated creatinine among blacks was 11.4-fold that of whites. Although adjustment for baseline glucose levels accounted for much of the association between ethnicity and elevated creatinine among women, adjustment for weight, systolic BP, uric acid, glucose, and socioeconomic status did not account for the association between ethnicity and renal impairment among men. The data suggest that there are ethnic differences in the development of early-onset renal dysfunction. Among women, these differences are modest and largely accounted for by differences in glucose levels early in adult life. Differences in race/ethnicity related risk of early-onset renal impairment are particularly large among men and are not accounted for by the metabolic or socioeconomic factors evaluated.",23,AMER SOC NEPHROLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1725 I ST, NW STE 510, WASHINGTON, DC 20006 USA",1046-6673,1533-3450,J AM SOC NEPHROL,J.

We performed a prospective study to examine whether serum GGT predicts diabetes and hypertension. Methods: Study participants were 4844 black and white men and women 18-30 years of age in 1985-1986; they were reexamined 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 years later. Year 0 GGT cutpoints were 12, 17, 25, and 36 U/L (overall 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles; the laboratory cutpoints for abnormal are 40 U/L in women and 50 U/L in men). We deleted 32 participants with prevalent diabetes and 140 participants with prevalent hypertension from the respective incidence analyses. Results: After adjustment for study center, race, sex, and age in proportional hazards regression, the hazard ratios across year 0 GGT categories were 1.0. 1.6, 1.7, 4.0 (95% confidence interval, 2.0-8.1), and 5.5 (2.7-11.1) for 15-year incident diabetes and 1.0, 1.2, 1.7 (1.2-2.2), 2.3 (1.7-3.2). and 2.3 (1.7-3.2) for hypertension. Additional adjustment for year 0 alcohol consumption, body mass index, cigarette smoking, and physical activity attenuated this relationship, but GGT remained a significant predictor. Conclusions: Serum GGT within a range regarded as physiologically normal is associated with incident diabetes and hypertension.

DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Community-based sample of 3325 black and white men and women aged 18-30y from four centers followed for 10y. Women pregnant at baseline or 10th year exam and persons without a recorded weight at both exams were excluded. Participants whose baseline BMI was greater than or equal to25 kg/m(2) were classified as overweight. Height, weight, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting insulin, and blood pressure were measured at baseline and Year 10. RESULTS: The mean (s.d.) of weight gained over 10y was 10.5 (10.0) kg (black men), 11.7 (11.0) (black women), 7.7 (8.0) (white men), and 7.2 (10.0) (white women). An increase in weight was associated with adverse changes in all factors in all race-sex groups. For example, a 9.1 kg (20-lb) weight increase in persons not overweight at baseline predicted an increase in LDL-C ranging from 0.23 mmol/l in black women to 0.28 mmol/l in black men and a decrease in HDL-C from 0.09 mmol/l (white women) to 0.11 mmol/l (white men) (all P<0.0001). The estimated change in triglycerides was greater in white than in black participants (P<0.02); no other racial differences were found. Changes in triglycerides (P<0.00001) and fasting insulin (P = 0.004) were greater in men than in women. Only for LDL-C was a weight change-associated increase significantly different (greater, P<0.001) for nonoverweight persons than for those overweight at baseline. None of these associations were highly specific. Mean levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, and systolic blood pressure improved among all those who lost or did not gain weight.

J,"Knox, SS; Hausdorff, J; Markovitz, JH",Reactivity as a predictor of subsequent blood pressure - Racial differences in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study,HYPERTENSION,Article,"This study investigated the association between cardiovascular reactivity and subsequent ambulatory blood pressure in 316 black and white men and women in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. Cardiovascular laboratory reactivity was examined in subjects 20 to 33 years old, and ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate were measured 3 years later. Average ambulatory pressure during a 24-hour period was regressed separately on stress reactivity and standard covariate risk factors in each race/gender subgroup. Blacks had higher blood pressure and heart rates than whites, men had higher blood pressure than women, and women had higher heart rates than men. After controlling for age, baseline systolic pressure, familial history of hypertension, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and exercise, systolic blood pressure reactivity to star tracing and cold pressor stress were significantly associated with systolic ambulatory pressure in black men and women 3 years later (partial r=0.24 to 0.37). Heart rate reactivity to video challenge and star tracing were also significantly predictive of subsequent ambulatory heart rate in blacks. Diastolic star tracing reactivity was significantly associated with subsequent ambulatory blood pressure in black women (r=0.23), and diastolic reactivity to video and star tracing were significantly predictive of ambulatory diastolic pressure in white men (r=0.39). We conclude that hyperresponsivity to stress may be a risk factor for subsequent blood pressure elevation in blacks and may be one pathway leading to the higher prevalence of hypertension in blacks than in whites.",43,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0194-911X,,HYPERTENSION,Hypertension,DEC,2002,40,6,914,919,,10.1161/01.HYP.0000041417.94797.57,6,Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,WOS:000179841300024,12468579,Bronze,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Cross-sectional data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study were used to examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with the IRS in 3,093 nondiabetic adults aged 28-40 years. Measures of BMI, fasting HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, glucose, and systolic blood pressure were combined into an IRS score. U.S. Census-derived neighborhood characteristics were summarized into a neighborhood socioeconomic score, with an increasing score signifying increasing socioeconomic advantage. RESULTS - Among white men and women, the IRS score was inversely related to neighborhood socioeconomic score. Neighborhood characteristics remained associated with the IRS score after controlling for personal income and education (adjusted mean differences for 95th vs. 5th percentile of neighborhood score: -0.24 standard deviation units [SE = 0.12] in men and -0.56 standard deviation units [SE = 0.10] in women). Among black participants, neighborhood score was inversely associated with IRS score in persons of high income and education (mean differences 95th vs. 5th percentile -0.54 [SE 0.26] in men and -0.52 [SE 0.26] in women) but positively associated or not associated with IRS score in persons of low income and education (mean differences 0.60 [SE 0.21] in men and 0.00 [SE 0.16] in women).

We sought to determine whether frequent attendance at religious services is associated with less smoking among young adults. Methods: This prospective cohort study of 4569 adults aged 20 to 32 years included approximately equal numbers of blacks and whites and men and women from 4 cities in the United States who attended the 1987/1988 examination of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Frequency of attendance at religious services and denominational affiliation were determined by self-report questionnaire in 1987/1988. Cigarette smoking was determined by interview at this time and again 3 years later. Results: Of 4544 participants who completed the tobacco questionnaire in 1987/1988,34% (891/2598) who attended religious services less than once per month or never and 23% (451/1946) who attended religious services at least once per month reported current smoking (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.0; P<.001).

Results Dairy consumption was inversely associated with the incidence of all IRS components among individuals who were overweight (body mass index greater than or equal to25 kg/m(2)) at baseline but not among leaner individuals (body mass index <25 kg/m(2)). The adjusted odds of developing IRS (2 or more components) were 72% lower (odds ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.58) among overweight individuals in the highest (&GE;35 times per week, 24/102 individuals) compared with the lowest (<10 times per week, 85/190 individuals) category of dairy consumption. Each daily occasion of dairy consumption was associated with a 21% lower odds of IRS (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.88). These associations were similar for blacks and whites and for men and women.

Hypothesis 2-those who attenuate weight gain because of a temporary increase in physical activity (PA) may maintain a lower body weight over time. METHODS: Data were from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a cohort of black and white men and women, aged 18-30 y at baseline, who attended up to five examinations over a 10 y period (n = 5115 at baseline). Longitudinal associations between physical activity and body weight changes were assessed, adjusting for secular trend, age, clinic site, education, smoking, alcohol intake, parity, percentage energy intake from fat, and changes in these variables over time. For hypothesis 1, concurrent associations of physical activity and body weight changes were examined. For hypothesis 2, we explored whether weight gain attenuation associated with increased PA during the initial 2-3 y of follow-up was sustained over 5 y. The study 2 analyses were conducted with three separate 5 y intervals: baseline to year 5 (n = 3641), years 2-7 (n = 3160), and years 5 - 10 (n = 2617). RESULTS: Hypothesis 1 - change in physical activity was inversely associated with change in body weight within all four race and sex sub-groups (P < 0.005). The predicted weight change associated with change in physical activity was four to five times larger in participants who were overweight compared with those who were not were overweight at baseline. Hypothesis 2 - an increase in physical activity during 2-3 y of follow-up was associated with an attenuation of weight gain that was sustained through 5 y of follow-up whether or not the physical activity increase was maintained during the later years. This finding persisted whether the starting point for the 5 y follow-up was year 2, year 5 or baseline (women only). Comparing participants who increased physical activity with those who decreased physical activity in the first 2-3 y of follow-up (eg by at least 2 h per week of stationary cycling for at least 6 months per year), the mean 5 y weight gain attenuation ranged from 0.8 to 2.8 kg.

The association between baseline HR and subsequent systolic BP (SBP) was explained by multivariable adjustment. However, HR was an independent predictor of subsequent diastolic BP (DBP) regardless of initial BP and other confounders in white men, white women, and black men (0.7 mm Hg increase per 10 bpm). We incorporated the part of the association that was already present at baseline by not adjusting for baseline DBP: the mean increase in subsequent DBP was 1.3 mm Hg per 10 bpm in white men, white women, and black men.

Analyses were conducted with 3,742 participants of the CARDIA study (945 white men, 1,024 white women, 781 black men, and 992 black women), evaluated in 1990 to 1091 with echocardiographic measurement of LVM. Analyses were stratified by gender and race. The relationships of LVM/height(2.7) and cardiovascular reactivity to physical and psychological stressors (treadmill exercise, cold presser, video game, and star-tracing tasks), were examined in both univariate and multivariate analyses adjusting for baseline BP, weight, and other relevant biobehavioral variables. The relationships between LVM and several psychosocial characteristics (hostility, anger, suppression, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and education) were also assessed. Systolic blood pressure (SEP) reactivity to exercise was significantly related to LVM in black and white men; LVM was 10% greater among white men with exaggerated (upper quintile) peak exercise SEP than among other white men. SEP reactivity to the cold presser test was related to LVM in all race/gender groups, although the relationship remained significant only among white men and women in the multivariate analysis. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reactivity to the video game was related to LVM only among black men in adjusted analyses. After adjusting for resting BP, weight, and other covariates in linear multiple regression models, SEP reactivity to exercise explained only 3% of the variance in LVM among white men. Otherwise, reactivity to other stressors or psychosocial variables accounted for no more than 1% of the variance in LVM. It was concluded that among a cohort of young adults, blood pressure reactivity to physical and mental stressors did not add substantially to the prediction of LVM when resting BP, weight, and other covariates were taken into account.",31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"655 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0895-7061,,AM J HYPERTENS,Am.

Measurements were made of fasting insulin (by an assay with little cross-reactivity to proinsulin) and fasting glucose on frozen samples from baseline and Year 7 examinations. Over the 7-year period, mean fasting insulin increased 10-25%, mean fasting glucose increased 7-10%, and mean body mass increased 7-12% across the four race-, sex-groups. The strongest predictor of both insulin increase and glucose increase was an increase in body mass over the 7 years. Adjusted for age and examination time period in race-, sex-specific repeated measures analyses, fasting insulin increased longitudinally by approximately 5 mu U/mL per 5 kg/m(2) increase in body mass index (p < 0.05). Adjusted for age and time period, fasting insulin increased over the 7 years by approximately 2.5 mu U/mL per 0.08 unit increase in waist/hip ratio (p < 0.05), although this association was much stronger cross-sectionally. In a similar model, each 100 unit decrease in physical activity longitudinally predicted a 0.1-0.2 mu U/mL increase in fasting insulin (p < 0.05 in black men only); this association was stronger and statistically significant in all race-, sex-groups cross-sectionally. Fasting insulin was not associated with energy intake either cross-sectionally or longitudinally, but age- and time-adjusted associations of insulin change with change in several nutrients (e.g., energy from fat) were statistically significant in whites.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether increased levels of these and other hemostatic factors (FVIII, von Willebrand factor [vWF]) were associated with other coronary risk factors in young adults participating in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. Hemostatic factors were measured in 1724 participants aged 23 to 35 years who were roughly balanced by sex and race (black/white). Fb was greater in women than men (black, 288 versus 253 mg/dL; white, 267 versus 240 mg/dL; overall P<.05 by Scheffe multiple-comparison test), and FVIII and vWF were higher in blacks than in whites (FVIII in men, 103% versus 88%, and in women, 104% versus 91%; vWF in men, 114% versus 98%, and in women, 117% versus 99%; P<.05). The latter factors were lower in those with blood group O, but within each blood group (except group A), blacks had significantly higher levels of FVIII and vWF. Fb was positively correlated with body mass index (r=.27 to .48, P<.001), total cholesterol (r=.13 to .17, P<.05), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(r=.15 to .22, P<.01) in all groups and with blood pressure, triglycerides, and cigarette smoking in white men. FVII correlated positively with cholesterol (r=.12 to .29, P<.05) and triglycerides (r=.23 to .32, P<.001) in all groups and with low-density lipoprotein in whites. FVIII and vWF correlated positively with body mass index and lipids in white women.

The relation between self-reported parental disease and risk factor levels was examined in 2,637 black and 2,478 white men and women aged 18-30 years at the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study baseline examination (1985-1986). Methods and Results. The prevalence of parental disease (at least one parent) in white versus black participants was 44% and 56% for hypertension, 47% and 44% for obesity, 16% and 13% for myocardial infarction, 11% and 17% for diabetes, and 6% and 10% for stroke, respectively. Among these young adults, parental hypertension was associated with higher sex- and age-adjusted systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Parental myocardial infarction was associated with higher plasma cholesterol, higher blood pressure levels, and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in white participants. Parental diabetes was associated with higher fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in all race-sex groups and with higher triglycerides and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol in black participants only. Parental history of obesity was related to less favorable age- and sex-adjusted lipid levels in white participants and higher blood pressure levels in black participants. Parental history of stroke was associated with higher systolic blood pressure levels in black participants. In general, these differences across family history were predicted only in part by obesity. The prevalence of more than one disease reported in parents occurred more frequently than would have been expected due to chance alone. Conclusions. These associations between parental disease and risk factors in their adult children probably reflects the impact of both environmental and genetic factors.

Whether sex hormone levels in young men are predictive of later risk of NAFLD is not known.METHODS:Among men in the prospective population-based multicenter Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (mean age 50; n = 837), we assessed whether testosterone and SHBG levels measured at study year 10 (median age 35 years) were associated with prevalent NAFLD at study year 25. NAFLD was defined using noncontrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan after excluding other causes of hepatic steatosis. The association of testosterone and SHBG with prevalent NAFLD was assessed by logistic regression.RESULTS:Total testosterone levels in young men were inversely associated with subsequent prevalent NAFLD on unadjusted analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.53-0.7, P < 0.001), although no longer significant after adjustment for year 10 metabolic covariates as well as change in metabolic covariates from years 10 to 25 (OR 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.27). In contrast, there was a significant inverse association of SHBG with prevalent NAFLD, independent of testosterone and metabolic covariates (OR 0.68, OR 0.51-0.92, P = 0.013). On formal mediation testing, visceral adiposity was found to explain similar to 41.0% (95% confidence interval 27%-73%) of the association of lower SHBG with prevalent NAFLD.CONCLUSIONS:Lower levels of SHBG in young men are associated with increase in prevalent NAFLD in middle age, independent of comprehensive metabolic risk factors.

SettingMulti-site, observational cohort study initially consisting of 2787 black and white women aged 18-30 at baseline (1985-86) and followed for 25years (Y25; 2010-2011). Population768 nulliparous women at baseline who reported 1 live birth by the Y25 exam. MethodsWe used Poisson regression to determine associations of exposures with PTB/SGA. Main outcome measuresPTB and/or SGA births. ResultsWomen with PTB (n=143) and/or SGA (n=88) were younger, had completed fewer years of education and were more likely to be black versus women without PTB/SGA (n=546). Women with PTB/SGA had lower fitness (5019 versus 5356seconds, P<0.002) and higher submaximal SBP than women without PTB/SGA (1441 versus 142 +/- 1mmHg, P<0.04). After adjustment, no exercise test variables were associated with PTB/SGA, though the association with HRR and submaximal SBP approached significance in the subset of women who completed the exercise test <5years before the index birth. ConclusionsNeither fitness nor haemodynamic responses to exercise a median of 5years preceding pregnancy, were associated with PTB/SGA. These findings indicate excess likelihood of PTB/SGA is not detectable by low fitness or exercise haemodynamic responses 5years preceding pregnancy, but exercise testing, especially HRR and submaximal SBP, may be more useful when conducted closer to the onset of pregnancy.

This study sought to clarify the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between self-reported marijuana use, and prediabetes (defined as fasting glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/l, 2 h glucose post OGTT 7.8-11.0 mmol/l or HbA(1c) 5.7-6.4% [39-47 mmol/mol]) and diabetes. Methods Data from the community-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study were used to determine marijuana use and the presence of prediabetes and diabetes among participants. The association between marijuana use and the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes was examined in 3,034 participants at CARDIA examination year 25 (2010-2011), while the incidence of prediabetes and diabetes according to previous marijuana use was assessed in 3,151 individuals who were free from prediabetes/diabetes at year 7 (1992-1993) and who returned for at least one of the four subsequent follow-up examinations over 18 years.

OBJECTIVE To estimate subgroup-specific effects of fast food price changes on fast food consumption and cardiometabolic outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty-year follow-up (5 examinations) in a biracial US prospective cohort: Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) (1985/1986-2005/2006, baseline N = 5115). Participants were aged 18 to 30 years at baseline; design indicated equal recruitment by race (black vs white), educational attainment, age, and sex. Community-level price data from the Council for Community and Economic Research were temporally and geographically linked to study participants' home address at each examination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Participant-reported number of fast food eating occasions per week, body mass index (BMI), and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) from fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. Covariates included individual-level and community-level social and demographic factors. RESULTS In repeated measures regression analysis, multivariable-adjusted associations between fast food price and consumption were nonlinear (quadratic, P < .001), with significant inverse estimated effects on consumption at higher prices; estimates varied according to race (interaction P = .04), income (P = .07). and education (P = .03). At the 10th percentile of price ($1.25/serving), blacks and whites had mean fast food consumption frequency of 2.20 (95% CI, 2.07-2.33) and 1.55 (1.45-1.65) times/wk, respectively, whereas at the 90th percentile of price ($1.53/serving), respective mean consumption estimates were 1.86 (1.75-1.97) and 1.50 (1.41-1.59) times/wk. We observed differential price effects on HOMA-IR (inverse for lower educational status only [interaction P = .005] and at middle income only [interaction P = .02]) and BMI (inverse for blacks, less education, and middle income; positive for whites, more education, and high income [all interaction P < .001]).

OBJECTIVES To identify common BP trajectories throughout early adulthood and to determine their association with presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) during middle age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort data from 4681 participants in the CARDIA study, who were black and white men and women aged 18 to 30 years at baseline in 1985-1986 at 4 urban US sites, collected through 25 years of follow-up (2010-2011). We examined systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mid-BP (calculated as [SBP+DBP]/2, an important marker of coronary heart disease risk among younger populations) at baseline and years 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25. Latent mixture modeling was used to identify trajectories in systolic, diastolic, and mid-BP over time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coronary artery calcification greater than or equal to Agatston score of 100 Hounsfield units (HU) at year 25. RESULTS We identified 5 distinct mid-BP trajectories: low-stable (21.8%; 95% CI, 19.9%-23.7%; n=987), moderate-stable (42.3%; 40.3%-44.3%; n=2085), moderate-increasing (12.2%; 10.4%-14.0%; n=489), elevated-stable (19.0%; 17.1%-20.0%; n=903), and elevated-increasing (4.8%; 4.0%-5.5%; n=217). Compared with the low-stable group, trajectories with elevated BP levels had greater odds of having a CAC score of 100 HU or greater. Adjusted odds ratios were 1.44 (95% CI, 0.83-2.49) for moderate-stable, 1.86 (95% CI, 0.91-3.82) for moderate-increasing, 2.28 (95% CI, 1.24-4.18), for elevated-stable, and 3.70 (95% CI, 1.66-8.20) for elevated-increasing groups. The adjusted prevalence of a CAC score of 100 HU or higher was 5.8% in the low-stable group. These odds ratios represent an absolute increase of 2.7%, 5%, 6.3%, and 12.9% for the prevalence of a CAC score of 100 HU or higher for the moderate-stable, moderate-increasing, elevated-stable and elevated-increasing groups, respectively, compared with the low-stable group. Associations were not altered after adjustment for baseline and year 25 BP. Findings were similar for trajectories of isolated systolic BP trajectories but were attenuated for diastolic BP trajectories. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Blood pressure trajectories throughout young adulthood vary, and higher BP trajectories were associated with an increased risk of CAC in middle age.

Recent studies suggest that shorter sleep duration is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but there is limited evidence regarding this association using high-quality, objective assessments of sleep. The aim of this study is to determine whether sleep duration is associated with CIMT. Methods-The study used an observational cohort consisting of 617 black and white middle-aged healthy participants (37-52 years; 58% female) in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression analyses were performed. Sleep duration was measured using wrist actigraphy monitors. CIMT was calculated using the average of 20 measurements of the mean common carotid, bulb, and internal CIMT, which was assessed using ultrasound images. Results-After adjusting for covariates, 1 hour of longer sleep duration was associated with 0.026 mm less CIMT among men (P=0.02; 95% CI,-0.047 to -0.005) and 0.001 mm less CIMT among women (P=0.91; 95% CI, -0.020 to 0.022). Segment-specific analyses indicated that the carotid bulb was a key driver of the observed association. Conclusions-Shorter objectively assessed sleep duration was associated with greater CIMT among men but not women.

BACKGROUND High CAC burden is associated with increased risk of coronary events beyond the FRS. Expert panel recommendations for CAC screening are based on data obtained in middle-age and older individuals. METHODS We included 2,831 CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study participants with an age range of 33 to 45 years. The number needed to screen ([NNS] number of people in each FRS stratum who need to be screened to detect 1 person with a CAC score above the specified cut point) was used to assess the yield of screening for CAC. CAC prevalence was compared across FRS strata using a chi-square test. RESULTS CAC scores >0 and >= 100 were present in 9.9% and 1.8% of participants, respectively. CAC prevalence and amount increased across higher FRS strata. A CAC score >0 was observed in 7.3%, 20.2%, 19.1%, and 44.8% of individuals with FRSs of 0 to 2.5%, 2.6% to 5%, 5.1% to 10%, and >10%, respectively (NNS = 14, 5, 5, and 2, respectively). A CAC score of >= 100 was observed in 1.3%, 2.4%, and 3.5% of those with FRSs of 0 to 2.5%, 2.6% to 5%, and 5.1% to 10%, respectively (NNS = 79, 41, and 29, respectively), but in 17.2% of those with an FRS >10% (NNS = 6). Similar trends were observed when findings were stratified by sex and race. CONCLUSIONS In this young to early middle-age cohort, we observed concordance between CAC prevalence/amount and FRS strata. Within this group, the yield of screening and possibility of identifying those with a high CAC burden (CAC score of >= 100) is low in those with an FRS of <= 10%, but considerable in those with an FRS >10%.

Methods and Results-Participants were 2171 middle-aged adults (58% female; 43% black) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who were free of cardiovascular disease. Depressive symptom clusters (z scores) were measured by questionnaires in 2000 to 2001, and CAC was measured by electron beam computed tomography in 2000 to 2001 and 2005 to 2006. There were 243 cases (11%) of incident CAC, defined as the absence of CAC at baseline and the presence of CAC at follow-up. Total depressive symptoms (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.33; P = 0.03) and the depressed affect cluster (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.33; P = 0.02) predicted incident CAC; however, the somatic, interpersonal distress, low positive affect, and pessimism clusters did not. The depressed affect-incident CAC relationship was independent of age, sex, race, education, and antidepressant use; was similar across sex and racial groups; and was partially accounted for by tobacco use and mean arterial pressure. Conclusions-In contrast to recent results indicating that the somatic cluster is the most predictive of cardiovascular outcomes, we found that the prospective association between depressive symptoms and incident CAC was driven by the depressed affect cluster. Our findings raise the possibility that there may not be 1 facet of depression that is the most cardiotoxic across all contexts.

We studied whether greater loss of forced vital capacity (FVC) early in life predicted incident hypertension. The sample was 3205 black and white men and women in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study examined between 1985 and 1986 (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults year 0, ages 18-30 years) and 2005-2006 and who were not hypertensive by year 10. FVC was assessed at years 0, 2, 5, 10, and 20. Proportional hazard ratios and linear regression models predicted incident hypertension at years 15 or 20 (n = 508) from the change in FVC (FVC at year 10 - peak FVC, where peak FVC was estimated as the maximum across years 0, 2, 5, and 10). Covariates included demographics, center, systolic blood pressure, FVC maximum, smoking, physical activity, asthma, and body mass index. Unadjusted cumulative incident hypertension was 25% in the lowest FVC loss quartile (Q1; median loss: 370 mL) compared with 12% cumulative incident hypertension in those who achieved peak FVC at year 10 (Q4). Minimally adjusted hazard ratio for Q1 versus Q4 was 2.21 (95% CI: 1.73-2.83), and this association remained significant in the fully adjusted model (1.37; 95% CI: 1.05-1.80). Decline in FVC from average age at peak (29.4 years) to 35 years old predicted incident hypertension between average ages 35 and 45 years.

Objective To analyze associations between marijuana (both current and lifetime exposure) and pulmonary function. Design, Setting, and Participants The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a longitudinal study collecting repeated measurements of pulmonary function and smoking over 20 years (March 26, 1985-August 19, 2006) in a cohort of 5115 men and women in 4 US cities. Mixed linear modeling was used to account for individual age-based trajectories of pulmonary function and other covariates including tobacco use, which was analyzed in parallel as a positive control. Lifetime exposure to marijuana joints was expressed in joint-years, with 1 joint-year of exposure equivalent to smoking 365 joints or filled pipe bowls. Main Outcome Measures Forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Results Marijuana exposure was nearly as common as tobacco exposure but was mostly light (median, 2-3 episodes per month). Tobacco exposure, both current and lifetime, was linearly associated with lower FEV1 and FVC. In contrast, the association between marijuana exposure and pulmonary function was nonlinear (P<.001): at low levels of exposure, FEV1 increased by 13 mL/joint-year (95% CI, 6.4 to 20; P<.001) and FVC by 20 mL/joint-year (95% CI, 12 to 27; P<.001), but at higher levels of exposure, these associations leveled or even reversed. The slope for FEV1 was -2.2 mL/joint-year (95% CI, -4.6 to 0.3; P=.08) at more than 10 joint-years and -3.2 mL per marijuana smoking episode/mo (95% CI, -5.8 to -0.6; P=.02) at more than 20 episodes/mo. With very heavy marijuana use, the net association with FEV1 was not significantly different from baseline, and the net association with FVC remained significantly greater than baseline (eg, at 20 joint-years, 76 mL [ 95% CI, 34 to 117]; P<.001).

The main objective of this study was to investigate whether overweight (body mass index (BMI) 25 to <30 kgm(-2)) and obese (BMI >= 30 kgm(-2)) young adults have poorer HRQoL 20 years later. Methods: We studied 3014 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a longitudinal, community-dwelling, biracial cohort from four cities. BMI was measured at baseline and 20 years later. HRQoL was assessed by the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores of the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey at year 20. Higher PCS or MCS scores indicate better HRQoL. Results: Mean year 20 PCS score was 52.2 for normal weight participants at baseline, 50.3 for overweight and 46.4 for obese (P-trend <0.001). This relation persisted after adjustment for baseline demographics, general health, and physical and behavioral risk factors and after further adjustment for 20-year changes in risk factors. No association was observed for MCS scores (P-trend 0.43).

Methods and Results-The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study is a cohort of 5115 white and black adults who were aged 18 to 30 years when they completed a baseline clinic examination from 1985 to 1986. Subsequent examinations were conducted 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 years later. After multivariable adjustment, no association was observed between average coffee, decaffeinated coffee, or caffeine consumption (years 0 and 7) and presence of CAC (score, >0 Agatston units at year 15 or 20), CAC progression (incident CAC at year 20 or increase in CAC score by >= 20 Agatston units), or high carotid intima-media thickness (>80th percentile, year 20). However, tea consumption displayed a nonsignificant trend for an inverse association with CAC (P = 0.08 for trend) and an inverse association with CAC progression (P = 0.04 for trend) but no association with high carotid intima-media thickness (P > 0.20 for trend). Stratification of the coffee analyses by sex, race, or smoking yielded similar nonsignificant patterns. Conclusion-We observed no substantial association between coffee or caffeine intake and coronary and carotid atherosclerosis. However, our results suggested an inverse association between tea and CAC but not carotid atherosclerosis.

Methods: This 20-year longitudinal study included 12 123 respondent days from 5115 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. Associations between food price, dietary intake, overall energy intake, weight, and homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores were assessed using conditional log-log and linear regression models. Results: The real price (inflated to 2006 US dollars) of soda and pizza decreased over time; the price of whole milk increased. A 10% increase in the price of soda or pizza was associated with a -7.12% (95% confidence interval [CI], -63.50 to -10.71) or -11.5% (95% CI, -17.50 to -5.50) change in energy from these foods, respectively. A $1.00 increase in soda price was also associated with lower daily energy intake (-124 [95% CI, -198 to -50] kcal), lower weight (-1.05 [95% CI, -1.80 to -0.31] kg), and lower HOMA-IR score (0.42 [95% CI, -0.60 to -0.23]); similar trends were observed for pizza. A $1.00 increase in the price of both soda and pizza was associated with greater changes in total energy intake (-181.49 [95% CI, -247.79 to -115.18] kcal), body weight (-1.65 [95% CI, -2.34 to 0.96] kg), and HOMA-IR (-0.45 [95% CI, -0.59 to -0.31]).

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 2364 participants enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who worked outside the home during year 20 of the study (2005-2006). Associations between walking or biking to work (self-reported time, distance, and mode of commuting) with body weight (measured height and weight); obesity (body mass index [BMI], calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, >= 30); fitness (symptom-limited exercise stress testing); objective moderate-vigorous physical activity (accelerometry); CVD risk factors (blood pressure [oscillometric systolic and diastolic]); and serum measures (fasting measures of lipid, glucose, and insulin levels) were separately assessed by sex-stratified multivariable linear (or logistic) regression modeling. Results: A total of 16.7% of participants used any means of active commuting to work. Controlling for age, race, income, education, smoking, examination center, and physical activity index excluding walking, men with any active commuting (vs none) had reduced likelihood of obesity (odds ratio [OR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.76), reduced CVD risk: ratio of geometric mean triglyceride levels (trig(active))/(trig(nonactive)) = 0.88 (95% Cl, 0.80 to 0.98); ratio of geometric mean fasting insulin (FI(active))/(FI(nonactive)) = 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.93); difference in mean diastolic blood pressure (millimeters of mercury) (DBP(active))-(DBP(nonactive)) = -1.67 (95% CI, -3.20 to -0.15); and higher fitness: mean difference in treadmill test duration (in seconds) in men (TT(active)) - (TT(nonactive)) = 50.0 (95% CI, 31.45 to 68.59) and women (TT(active)) - (TT(nonactive)) = 28.77 (95% Cl, 11.61 to 45.92).

Common polymorphisms of the HNF-1 alpha gene (HNF1A) were recently associated with plasma C-reactive protein and gamma-glutamyl transferase concentration in middle-aged to older European Americans (EA). Methods and Results-We assessed whether common variants of HNF1A are associated with C-reactive protein, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and other atherosclerotic and metabolic risk factors, in the large, population-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study of healthy young EA (n = 2154) and African American (AA; n = 2083) adults. The minor alleles of Ile27Leu (rs1169288) and Ser486Asn (rs2464196) were associated with 0.10 to 0.15 standard deviation units lower C-reactive protein and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in EA. The same HNF1A coding variants were associated with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, creatinine, and fibrinogen in EA. We replicated the associations between HNF1A coding variants and C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and renal function in a second population-based sample of EA adults 65 years and older from the Cardiovascular Health Study. The HNF1A Ser486Asn and/or Ile27Leu variants were also associated with increased risk of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults and with incident coronary heart disease in Cardiovascular Health Study. The Ile27Leu and Ser486Asn variants were 3-fold less common in AA than in EA. There was little evidence of association between HNF1A genotype and atherosclerosis-related phenotypes in AA. Conclusions-Common polymorphisms of HNF1A seem to influence multiple phenotypes related to cardiovascular risk in the general population of younger and older EA adults.

Methods: We examined the independent association of prior incarceration with incident hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia using the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study-a cohort of young adults aged 18 to 30 years at enrollment in 1985-1986, balanced by sex, race (black and white), and education (high school education or less). We also examined the association of incarceration with left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography and with barriers to health care access. Results: Of 4350 participants, 288 (7%) reported previous incarceration. Incident hypertension in young adulthood was more common among former inmates than in those without incarceration history (12% vs 7%; odds ratio, 1.7 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.2-2.6]), and this association persisted after adjustment for smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use, and family income (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.6 [95% CI, 1.0-2.6]). Incarceration was significantly associated with incident hypertension in those groups with the highest prevalence of prior incarceration, ie, black men (AOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.5]) and less-educated participants (AOR, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.0-17.3]). Former inmates were more likely to have left ventricular hypertrophy (AOR, 2.7, [95% CI, 0.9-7.9]) and to report no regular source for medical care (AOR, 2.5, [95% CI, 1.3-4.8]).

However, this hypothesis has not been tested in humans. Objective To establish the relation of oxidized LDL with metabolic syndrome in the general community. Design, Setting, and Participants The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is a population-based, prospective, observational study. We studied 1889 participants who were between the ages of 18 and 30 years at the time of recruitment in 1985 and 1986 and living in 1 of 4 US metropolitan areas (41% African American; 56% women) and were seen both at year 15 (2000-2001, ages 33-45 years) and year 20 examinations (2005-2006). Main Outcome Measure The longitudinal association of oxidized LDL and incident metabolic syndrome. Oxidized LDL was measured with a monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III of the National Cholesterol Education Program. Results Incident metabolic syndrome was diagnosed at the year 20 follow-up in 12.9% (243 of 1889) of participants who did not have metabolic syndrome at the 15-year follow-up. The odds ratios (ORs) for incident metabolic syndrome after 5 years' follow-up and adjusted for age, sex, race, study center, cigarette smoking, body mass index, physical activity, and LDL cholesterol levels by quintiles of oxidized LDL were 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.8) for the second quintile (55.4-69.1 U/L); 2.4 (95% CI, 1.3-4.3) for the third quintile (69.2-81.2 U/L); 2.8 (95% CI, 1.5-5.1) for the fourth quintile (81.3-97.3 U/L); and 3.5 (95% CI, 1.9-6.6) for the fifth quintile (>= 97.4U/L). The adjusted ORs for incidence of dichotomous components of metabolic syndrome in the highest vs the lowest quintile of oxidized LDL were 2.1 (95% CI, 1.2-3.6) for abdominal obesity, 2.4 (95% CI, 1.5-3.8) for high fasting glucose, and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-4.0) for high triglycerides. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not associated with incident metabolic syndrome or with any of its components in the fully adjusted model containing oxidized LDL.

Two hundred seventeen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in black participants and 171 in white participants from 17 genes were genotyped. In blacks, 5 SNPs in the ATP1A2, HIF1A, NOS3, and PPARGC1A loci tended to be associated (P<0.05) with baseline duration in a multivariate regression model. Blacks (n=99) with at least 4 of the most-favorable genotypes at these loci had an approximate to 2-minute longer baseline duration than those with only 2 such genotypes (P<0.0001). In whites, the HIF1A rs1957757 and PPARGC1A rs3774909 markers tended to be associated with baseline duration, but the association of a multimarker construct of the most-favorable genotypes at both SNPs with baseline duration was not statistically significant.

We used fixed-effects models to examine the association of smoking bans with within-person change in current smoking risk, smoking intensity (smoking >= 10 cigarettes/day on average vs. <10 cigarettes/day), and quitting attempts, using both linear and nonlinear adjustment for secular trends. In models assuming a linear secular trend, smoking bans were associated with a decline in current smoking risk and smoking intensity and an increased likelihood of a quitting attempt. The association with current smoking was greatest among participants with a bachelor's degree or higher.

Objective To evaluate the association between lactation and progression to diabetes using biochemical testing both before and after pregnancy and accounting for prepregnancy cardiometabolic measures, gestational diabetes (GD), and lifestyle behaviors. Design, Setting, and Participants For this US multicenter, community-based 30-year prospective cohort study, there were 1238 women from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study of young black and white women ages 18 to 30 years without diabetes at baseline (1985-1986) who had 1 or more live births after baseline, reported lactation duration, and were screened for diabetes up to 7 times during 30 years after baseline (1986-2016). Exposures Time-dependent lactation duration categories (none, >0 to 6 months, >6 to <12 months, and >= 12 months) across all births since baseline through 30 years. Main Outcomes and Measures Diabetes incidence rates per 1000 person-years and adjusted relative hazards (RH) with corresponding 95% CIs, as well as proportional hazards regression models adjusted for biochemical, sociodemographic, and reproductive risk factors, as well as family history of diabetes, lifestyle, and weight change during follow-up. Results Overall 1238 women were included in this analysis (mean [SD] age, 24.2 [3.7] years; 615 black women). There were 182 incident diabetes cases during 27 598 person-years for an overall incidence rate of 6.6 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 5.6-7.6); and rates for women with GD and without GD were 18.0 (95% CI, 13.3-22.8) and 5.1 (95% CI, 4.2-6.0), respectively (P for difference < .001). Lactation duration showed a strong, graded inverse association with diabetes incidence: adjusted RH for more than 0 to 6 months, 0.75 (95% CI, 0.51-1.09); more than 6 months to less than 12 months, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.31-0.87), and 12 months or more 0.53 (0.29-0.98) vs none (0 days) (P for trend = .01). There was no evidence of effect modification by race, GD, or parity.

In 2005, 2 measures of short-term HRV, the SD of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), were calculated for participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, and then categorized into quartiles. Five years later, 3 cognitive tests were administered for verbal memory (""Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test"", RAVLT, range 0-15), processing speed (""Digit Symbol Substitution Test"", DSST, range 0-133), and executive function (""Stroop interference""). Two thousand one hundred and eighteen participants (57.7% female, 42.2% Black) with a mean baseline age of 45.3 years were included in this analysis. In demographic-adjusted models, compared to participants with quartile 1 SDNN (lowest quartile), participants in the upper quartiles of SDNN scored better on the DSST (quartile 4: beta = 1.83 points better, P = 0.03; and quartile 3: beta = 1.95 points better, P = 0.03) and on the stroop (quartile 3: beta = 1.19 points better, P < 0.05; and quartile2: beta = 1.44 points better, P = 0.02).

Design, setting, participants, & measurements We conducted a cohort study among young adults with preserved eGFR (i.e., eGFR >= 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) using data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At scheduled examinations occurring every 5 years and starting at study year 10 (calendar years, 1995-1996), cystatin C was collected over a 10-year period, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was collected over a 15-year period. We investigated the cross-sectional association between current and cumulative marijuana use (in marijuana-years; one marijuana-year equals 365 days of marijuana use) and eGFR by cystatin C (eGFR(cys)) at year 10.

The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,Article,"Background: Findings in the observational retail food environment and obesity literature are inconsistent, potentially due to a lack of adjustment for residual confounding. Methods: Using data from the CARDIA study (n = 12 174 person-observations; 6 examinations; 1985-2011) across four US cities (Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; Oakland, CA), we used instrumental-variables (IV) regression to obtain causal estimates of the longitudinal associations between the percentage of neighbourhood food stores or restaurants (per total food outlets within 1 km network distance of respondent residence) with body mass index (BMI), adjusting for individual-level socio-demographics, health behaviours, city, year, total food outlets and market-level prices. To determine the presence and extent of bias, we compared the magnitude and direction of results with ordinary least squares (OLS) and random effects (RE) regression, which do not control for residual confounding, and with fixed effects (FE) regression, which does not control for time-varying residual confounding. Results: Relative to neighbourhood supermarkets (which tend to be larger and have healthier options than grocery stores), a higher percentage of grocery stores [mean=53.4%; standard deviation (SD) = 31.8%] was positively associated with BMI [beta = 0.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.01, 0.10] using IV regression.

However, this could be confounded by abdominal fat mass before pregnancy because it is unknown whether abdominal fat mass, independently of body size, affects GWG and breastfeeding behavior. Objective: We investigated how maternal prepregnaney fat distribution, described by waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BM!), is associated with GWG and breastfeeding behavior. Design: We analyzed 1371 live births to 1024 women after enrollment in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (1985-1996). For each birth, maternal prepregnancy BMI and WC were measured at year 0 (baseline), 2, 5, or 7 examinations. Recalled GWG and breastfeeding behavior were collected at years 7 and 10. GWG was analyzed by using linear regression and breastfeeding behavior by using logistic regression and discrete-time logistic regression. Results: Adjusted for potential confounders, a 1-cm larger WC adjusted for BMI Was associated with a 0.19-kg (95% CI: -0.29-, -0.10-kg) lower GWG. In contrast, a 1-unit higher BMI adjusted for WC was associated with a 0.27-kg (95% CI: 0.06-, 0.47-kg) higher GWG. The OR for ever breastfeeding compared with never breastfeeding was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.97) per I-cm larger WC after adjustment for BMI, whereas it was 1.10(95% CI: 1.02, 1.19) per 1-unit higher BMI adjusted for WC. Conclusions: Maternal prepregnancy body size was differently associated with GWG and breastfeeding behavior depending on the location of the fat mass. Thus, maternal fat distribution may be a more important determinant of GWG and breastfeeding behavior than BM I alone.

African Americans have higher clinic BP compared with Whites but few data are available on racial differences in ABPM measures. METHODS We compared ABPM measures between African American (n = 178) and White (n = 103) participants at the Year 5 Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study visit. BP was measured during a study visit and the second and third measurements were averaged. ABPM was conducted over the following 24 hours. RESULTS Mean +/- SD age of participants was 29.8 +/- 3.8 years and 30.8 +/- 3.5 years for African Americans and Whites, respectively. Mean daytime systolic BP (SBP) was 3.90 (SD 1.18) mm Hg higher among African Americans compared with Whites (P < 0.001) after age-gender adjustment and 1.71 (SD 1.03) mm Hg higher after multivariable adjustment including mean clinic SBP (P = 0.10). After multivariable adjustment including mean clinic SBP, nighttime SBP was 4.83 (SD 1.11) mm Hg higher among African Americans compared with Whites (P < 0.001). After multivariable adjustment, the African Americans were more likely than Whites to have nocturnal hypertension (prevalence ratio: 2.44, 95% CI: 0.99-6.05) and nondipping (prevalence ratio: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.39-4.48). The prevalence of masked hypertension among African Americans and Whites was 4.4% and 2.1%, respectively, (P = 0.49) and white coat hypertension was 3.3% and 3.9%, respectively (P = 0.99).

This study investigated the association of HbA(1c) with CAC progression in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We included 2,076 participants with HbA(1c) and noncontrast computed tomography (CT) assessed at baseline (2005-2006), and CT repeated 5 years later (2010-2011). CAC progression was defined as 1) incident CAC (increase >0 Agatston units among those with no CAC at baseline), 2) any CAC progression (increase >10 Agatston units between examinations), and 3) advanced CAC progression (increase >100 Agatston units between examinations). RESULTS During the 5-year follow-up period, 12.9% of participants without baseline CAC developed incident CAC; among all participants, 18.2% had any CAC progression and 5.4% had advanced CAC progression. Higher HbA(1c) was associated with incident CAC (risk ratio [RR] = 1.45; 95% CI 1.02, 2.06), any CAC progression (RR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.16, 1.96), and advanced CAC progression (RR = 2.42; 95% CI 1.47, 3.99) after adjustment for sociodemographic factors.

Objective: We studied time-and age-related individual and population-wide changes in a dietary quality score and food groups during 1985-2006. Design: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study of 5115 black and white men and women [aged 18-30 y at year 0 (1985-1986)] assessed diet at examinations at study years 0, 7 (1992-1993), and 20 (2005-2006). The dietary quality score, which was validated by its inverse association with cardiovascular disease risk, summed 46 food groups rated by investigators as positive or negative on the basis of hypothesized health effects. We used repeated-measures regression to estimate time-specific mean diet scores and servings per day of food groups. Results: In 2652 participants with all 3 diet assessments, the mean (+/- SD) dietary quality score increased from 64.1 +/- 13.0 at year 0 to 71.1 +/- 12.6 at year 20, which was mostly attributable to increased age. However, the secular trend, which was estimated from differences of dietary quality scores across time at a fixed age (age-matched time trend) decreased. The diet score was higher in whites than in blacks and in women than in men and increased with education, but demographic gaps in the score narrowed over 20 y. There tended to be increases in positively rated food groups and decreases in negatively rated food groups, which were generally similar in direction across demographic groups. Conclusions: The CARDIA study showed many age-related, desirable changes in food intake over 20 y of observation, despite a secular trend toward a lower diet quality.

Objective: The objective was to examine the longitudinal association between diets consistent with the 2005 DGA and subsequent weight gain. Design: We used data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a cohort of black and white men and women aged 18-30 y at baseline who attended <= 7 examinations from 1985-1986 to 2005-2006 (n = 4913). We created a 100-point Diet Quality Index (2005 DQI) to rate participants' diets based on meeting the 2005 DGA key recommendations. Longitudinal models of weight gain were adjusted for physical activity, smoking, energy intake, age, education, sex, and initial body mass index (BMI) and included interaction terms of DQI by race and initial BMI (if statistically significant). Results: We found effect modification by race (likelihood ratio test, P < 0.03 in all models). The mean adjusted 20-y weight change was +19.4 kg for blacks and +11.2 kg for whites with high diet quality (DQI >70) and +17.8 for blacks and +13.9 for whites with a DQI <50 (P < 0.05). In race-specific Cox models (with interaction terms for DQI x initial BMI, P < 0.05), a 10-point increase in DQI score was associated with a 10% lower risk of gaining 10 kg in whites with an initial BMI (in kg/m(2)) <25 but with a 15% higher risk in blacks with baseline obesity (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our findings do not support the hypothesis that a diet consistent with the 2005 DGA benefits long-term weight maintenance in American young adults.

Objective: We considered that dyslipidemia may predispose women to both conditions and that prepregnancy lipids may be related to preterm birth risk. We hypothesized that low or high prepregnancy plasma lipids would be associated with preterm birth. Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 1010 women (49% black) enrolled in the multicenter, prospective Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study with at least one singleton birth during 20 yr of follow-up were evaluated. Main Outcome Measure: Postbaseline preterm births less than 34 wk or 34 to less than 37 wk vs. greater than 37 wk gestation. Results: We detected a U-shaped relationship between prepregnancy cholesterol concentrations and preterm birth risk. Women with prepregnancy cholesterol in the lowest quartile compared with the second quartile (<156 vs. 156-171 mg/dl) had an increased risk for preterm birth 34 to less than 37 wk (odds ratio 1.86; 95% confidence interval 1.10, 3.15) and less than 34 wk (odds ratio 3.04; 1.35, 6.81) independent of race, age, parity, body mass index, hypertension during pregnancy, physical activity, and years from measurement to birth. Prepregnancy cholesterol in the highest quartile (>195 mg/dl) was also associated with preterm birth less than 34 wk among women with normotensive pregnancies (odds ratio 3.80; 95% confidence interval 1.07, 7.57). There were no associations between prepregnancy triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and preterm birth. Conclusions: Both low and high prepregnancy cholesterol were related to preterm birth risk. These may represent distinct pathways to the heterogeneous outcome of preterm birth. Additional studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms that link low or high cholesterol to preterm birth and later-life sequelae.

Lower plasma LDL-C was observed with the rare allele. Plasma apoE level was strongly associated with HCR-2 variant genotype in all three GENOA samples (P <= 0.002), indicating an effect on apoE concentration.

Results: Despite clinically significant increases in BMI and waist circumference, total T and free T tended to decline, whereas SHBG remained relatively constant. BMI and waist circumference were directly correlated with free T and inversely correlated with SHBG in cross-sectional analyses. In longitudinal, multivariable analyses, an annualized increase in BMI was inversely related to a concurrent annualized decrease in SHBG (beta = -0.79 ng/dl, and SE = 0.22 in Blacks; beta = -1.07 ng/dl; and SE = 0.31 in Whites).

Design: Participants wore an Actiwatch (Mini Mitter, Inc) for 3 days on two occasions approximately 1 year apart. Participants: N = 669 participants aged 38-50 years from the Chicago site of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort study. Measurements and Results: Sleep measures included sleep duration, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and time in bed. For each sleep parameter, total variance was decomposed into between-subject variance, withinsubject variance from day to day, and within-subject variance from year to year. The standard deviation was calculated from the variance. Analysis yielded a within-subject daily standard deviation (SD) of 1.26 hours and a within-subject yearly SD of 0.39 hours for sleep duration. Daily SD was 30.7 minutes and yearly SD was 6.3 minutes for within-subject variability of sleep latency. Daily SD was 8.4% and yearly SD was 2.7% for within-subject variability of sleep efficiency. Finally, daily SD was 1.31 hours and yearly SD was 0.52 hours for within-subject variability of time in bed. Conclusions: For each of the 4 sleep characteristics, nightly variability was much greater than yearly variability, meaning sleep behavior changes little in one year in this cohort of early middle-aged adults, despite large daily fluctuations.

Methods and Results - Participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, including white and black adults 18 to 30 years of age at the initial examination in 1985 to 1986, were stratified into groups by baseline BMI and change in BMI (stable/decreased, increased > 2 kg/m(2), or fluctuating) across all 6 examinations between years 0 and 15 of the study. Changes in metabolic syndrome components were compared between groups. Among 1358 men and 1321 women, 16.3% maintained a stable BMI, 73.9% had an increased BMI, and 9.8% had a fluctuating BMI. Over 15 years, participants with stable BMI had essentially unchanged levels of metabolic syndrome components, regardless of baseline BMI, whereas those with increased BMI had progressively worsening levels. For example, men with a baseline BMI of 20.0 to 24.9 kg/m(2) and stable BMI during follow-up had a mean increase of only 15 mg/dL in fasting triglycerides over 15 years compared with 65 mg/dL (P < 0.001) in those whose BMI increased. Incidence of metabolic syndrome at year 15 was lower in the stable BMI group (2.2%) compared with the increased BMI group (18.8%; P < 0.001).

We tested whether blood pressure changes during psychological stress predict subsequent coronary calcification (CaC) in young healthy adults. We evaluated 2816 healthy black and white women, 20 to 35 years of age, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, who were not using medication for hypertension or diabetes in 1987 - 1988. Participants completed video game and star tracing tasks while their blood pressure was recorded. Thirteen years later ( 2000 - 2001), they completed computed tomography measures of CaC. Overall 9.3% ( 261 of 2816) had CaC present at follow-up. Each 10 mm Hg change in systolic blood pressure during the video game was associated with a 24% increased odds of having CaC at follow-up (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.46; P = 0.008). This association persisted after adjustment for age, race, sex, education, smoking, alcohol, family history of myocardial infarction, smoking, daily alcohol consumption, body mass index, and resting or baseline blood pressure ( odds ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.58; P = 0.006). Blood pressure changes during the star tracing task were not associated with subsequent CaC. Blood pressure changes during a video game predicted the presence of CaC 13 years later.

We tested the hypothesis that parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) regulation is one such mechanism. Methods In a cross-sectional study, electrocardiogram-derived RR interval variability (RRV), a non-invasive index of cardiac PNS regulation, and SES, measured as educational attainment and income, were collected in 756 subjects in the CARDIA study of heart disease in young adults. Results Relative to those with less than a high school education, those with high school to college and post-college education had 26% (&beta; = 0.233) and 43% (&beta; = 0.355) greater low frequency (LF) RRV, respectively, adjusted for age, sex, and race. For high frequency (HF) RRV, race interacted with income: relative to low income whites, intermediate aid high income whites had 133 and 191% greater HF power, respectively, while intermediate and high income blacks had 32 and 44% greater HF RRV, respectively, relative to low income blacks.

Potential contributing factors to the increased prevalence of obesity in Black women include a more sedentary lifestyle, higher energy intake, earlier menarche, and earlier age at first childbirth.

Although widely used in epidemiological studies, self-report has been shown to underestimate the prevalence of cigarette smoking in some populations. Methods. In the CARDIA study, self-report of cigarette smoking was validated against a biochemical marker of nicotine uptake, serum cotinine. Results. The prevalence of smoking was slightly lower when defined by self-report (30.9%) than when defined by cotinine levels equal to or greater than 14 ng/mL (32.2%, P < .05). The misclassification rate (proportion of reported nonsmokers with cotinine levels of at least 14 ng/mL) was 4.2% and was significantly higher among subjects who were Black, had a high school education or less, or were reported former smokers. Possible reasons for misclassification include reporting error, environmental tobacco smoke, and an inappropriate cutoff point for delineation of smoking status. Using self-report as the gold standard, the cotinine cutoff points that maximized sensitivity and specificity were 14, 9, and 15 ng/mL for all, White, and Black subjects, respectively. The misclassification rate remained significantly higher in Black than in White subjects using these race-specific criteria. Conclusion. Misclassification of cigarette smoking by self-report was low in these young adults; however, within certain race/education groups, self-report may underestimate smoking prevalence by up to 4%.",300,AMER PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOC INC,WASHINGTON,"1015 FIFTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005",0090-0036,,AM J PUBLIC HEALTH,Am.

Further, among various regional distributions of lean and fat mass in females, truncal lean mass was the strongest predictor. Total lean mass is more strongly associated with asthma than total fat mass among females.

Our objective is to determine whether racial discrimination in medical settings is protective for blacks against OPR misuse, thus mediating the black-white disparities in OPR misuse. Methods We used data from 3528 black and white adults in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, an ongoing multi-site cohort. We employ causal mediation methods, with race (black vs white) as the exposure, lifetime discrimination in medical settings prior to year 2000 as the mediator, and OPR misuse after 2000 as the outcome. Results We found black participants were more likely to report discrimination in a medical setting (20.3% vs 0.9%) and less likely to report OPR misuse (5.8% vs 8.0%, OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.55, 0.93, adjusted for covariates). Our mediation models suggest that when everyone is not discriminated against, the disparity is wider with black persons having even lower odds of reporting OPR misuse (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.45, 0.89) compared to their white counterparts, suggesting racial discrimination in medical settings is a risk factor for OPR misuse rather than protective.

Previous studies have shown a more adverse metabolic risk profile is associated with more advanced biological aging. The associations between epigenetic biomarkers of age with MetS, however, are not well understood. We therefore investigated the associations between epigenetic age acceleration and MetS severity score and incident MetS.ResultsA subset of study participants with available whole blood at examination years 15 and 20 from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study underwent epigenomic profiling using the Illumina MethylationEPIC Beadchip (similar to 850,000 sites). Intrinsic and extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA and EEAA) were calculated from DNA methylation levels. The MetS severity score was positively associated with IEAA at years 15 (P=0.016) and 20 (P=0.016) and EEAA at year 20 (P=0.040) in cross-sectional analysis. IEAA at year 20 was significantly associated with incident MetS at year 30 (OR=1.05 [95% CI 1.01, 1.10], P=0.028).ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first report of the longitudinal association between epigenetic age acceleration and MetS. These findings suggest that a higher MetS severity score is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging and such aging may play a role in the development of metabolic disorders, potentially serving as a useful biomarker of and early detection tool for future MetS.",0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1868-7075,1868-7083,CLIN EPIGENETICS,Clin.

Data were from a sample of 3758 black or white adults in CARDIA, a community-based cohort recruited in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN, and Oakland, CA in 1985-6 (year 0). Racial and gender discrimination were assessed using the Experiences of Discrimination scale. CVH was evaluated using a 12-point composite outcome modified from the Life's Simple 7, with higher scores indicating better health. Multivariable linear regressions were used to evaluate the associations between different perceptions of discrimination and CVH scores two decades later by race and gender simultaneously. Reporting racial and gender discrimination in >= 2 settings were 48% of black women, 42% of black men, 10% of white women, and 5% of white men. Year 30 CVH scores (mean, SD) were 7.9(1.4), 8.1(1.6), 8.8(1.6), and 8.7(1.3), respectively. Compared with those of their race-gender groups reporting no discrimination, white women reporting only gender-based discrimination saw an adjusted score difference of +0.3 (95% CI: 0.0,0.6), whereas white men reporting only racial discrimination had on average a 0.4 (95% CI: 0.1,0.8) higher score, and scores among white men reporting both racial and gender discrimination were on average 0.6 (95% CI: 1.1,-0.1) lower than those of their group reporting no discrimination. Consistent with predictions of the IP model, the associations of reported racial and gender discrimination with future CVH were different for different racially-defined gender groups. More research is needed to understand why reported racial and gender discrimination might better predict deterioration in CVH for whites than blacks, and what additional factors associated with gender and race contribute variability to CVH among these groups.",1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2352-8273,,SSM-POPUL HLTH,SSM-Popul.

However, the interplay of a broad array of factors that influence health status may not be adequately captured with parametric multivariate regression. This study investigated associations between several health determinants and SRH using recursive partitioning methods. This non-parametric analytic approach aimed to reflect the social-ecological model of health, emphasizing relationships between multiple health determinants, including biological, behavioral, and from social/physical environments. The study sample of 3648 men and women was drawn from the year 15 (2000-2001) data collection of the CARDIA Study, USA, in order to study a young adult sample. Classification tree analysis identified 15 distinct, mutually exclusive, subgroups (eight with a larger proportion of individuals with higher SRH, and seven with a larger proportion of lower SRH), and multi-domain risk and protective factors associated with subgroup membership. Health determinant profiles were not uniform between subgroups, even for those with similar health status. The subgroup with the largest proportion of higher SRH was characterized by several protective factors, whilst that with the largest proportion of lower SRH, with several negative risk factors; certain factors were associated with both higher and lower SRH subgroups. In the full sample, physical activity, education and income were highest ranked by variable importance (random forests analysis) in association with SRH. This exploratory study demonstrates the utility of recursive partitioning methods in studying the joint impact of multiple health determinants. The findings indicate that factors do not affect SRH in the same way across the whole sample.

At the time, little was known about long-term retention of young, healthy and mobile adults or minorities. We present retention strategies and rates over 25 years, and predictors of participation at the year 25 follow-up examination of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a longitudinal investigation of coronary artery disease risk factors in a biracial population initially ages 18-30 years recruited from four U.S. centers in 1985. Methods: CARDIA has employed a range of strategies to enhance retention, including two contacts per year, multiple tracking methods to locate participants lost-to-follow-up, use of birthday and holiday cards, participant newsletters, examination scheduling accommodations and monetary reimbursements, and a standing committee whose primary purpose has been to continually review retention rates and strategies and identify problems and successes. Results: For 25 years, CARDIA has maintained > 90% contact with participants between examinations, over 80% at any 2-year interval, and a 72% 25-year examination attendance rate. Baseline predictors of year 25 examination attendance include white race, female sex, older age, higher education, nonsmoking and moderate alcohol consumption.

In the context of identifying early biomarkers of risk, we examined associations of plasma clusterin and characteristics of AD in middle-aged individuals from the community. Materials and methods Subjects were 639 cognitively normal individuals (mean age 50 +/- 3.5) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Brain MRI sub-study. Clusterin was quantified using ELISA (mean 255 +/- 31 ng/ml). Associations were assessed between clusterin and volumes of brain regions known to atrophy in early AD, including entorhinal cortex (ECV), hippocampus (HV), and medial temporal lobe (MTLV) volumes (cm 3). Total brain volume (TBV) and volumes of structures affected in later AD were examined for comparison. Results In multivariable models, higher clusterin had a negative non-linear association with ECV (combined left and right hemispheres), and this association was influenced by the highest clusterin levels. Compared to mean clusterin, 1 and 2 standard deviation (SD) level increases in clusterin were associated with -2.1% (95% CI: -3.3,-0.9) and -7.3% (95% CI: -11.3,-3.3) lower ECV, respectively. Similar relationships were observed between clusterin and HV, although the relationship was stronger for left-side HV than the right-side. However, the association was not significant after adjusting for covariates. Negative non-linear associations between clusterin and MTLV were strongest for the left side: compared to mean clusterin, 1 and 2 SD level increases in clusterin were associated with -0.9% (95% CI: -1.9, 0.1) and -3.7% (95% CI: -7.1, -0.3) lower MTLV. There were no significant associations between clusterin and brain structures affected in later AD.

In a bidirectional longitudinal examination of healthy adults, we analysed the following two hypotheses: (1) rapid decline (ie, highest tertile of lung function decline) predicts eUAE and (2) eUAE predicts rapid decline. Methods We performed a secondary data analysis from 3052 eligible participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. For analysis 1, the predictor was rapid decline in lung function between the peak value (attained at or before CARDIA visit year 10 or Y10 at a mean age of 35 years) and Y20; and the outcome was incident eUAE at Y20 and/or Y25.

J,"Skropanic, D; Fufaa, G; Cai, B",The Association Between Changes in Insulin Sensitivity and Consumption of Tobacco and Alcohol in Young Adults: Ordinal Logistic Regression Approach,CUREUS,Article,"Context Reduced insulin sensitivity is one of the traditional risk factors for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Reduced insulin sensitivity leads to insulin resistance, which in turn can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes. Few studies have examined factors such as blood pressure, tobacco and alcohol consumption that influence changes in insulin sensitivity over time especially among young adults. Purpose To examine temporal changes in insulin sensitivity in young adults (18-30 years of age at baseline) over a period of 20 years by taking into account the effects of tobacco and alcohol consumptions at baseline. In other words, the purpose of the present study is to examine if baseline tobacco and alcohol consumptions can be used in predicting lowered insulin sensitivity. Method This is a retrospective study using data collected by the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Participants were enrolled into the study in 1985 (baseline) and followed up to 2005. Insulin sensitivity, measured by the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), was recorded at baseline and 20 years later, in 2005. The number of participants included in the study was 3,547. The original study included a total of 5,112 participants at baseline. Of these, 54.48% were female, and 45.52% were male; 45.31% were 18 to 24 years of age, and 54.69% were 25 to 30 years of age. Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess changes in insulin sensitivity. Changes in insulin sensitivity from baseline were calculated and grouped into three categories (more than 15%, more than 8.5% to at most 15%, and at most 8.5%), which provided the basis for employing ordinal logistic regression to assess changes in insulin sensitivity. The effects of alcohol and smoking consumption at baseline on the change in insulin sensitivity were accounted for by including these variables in the model. Results Daily alcohol consumption (ml/day) at baseline was not associated with changes in insulin sensitivity (OR = 0.998, 95% CI 0.995-1.001), while the number of cigarettes consumed per day at baseline was statistically significantly associated with changes in insulin sensitivity (OR = 1.016, 95% CI 1.007-1.025). Covariates such as age (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.031-1.071), mean arterial blood pressure (OR = 0.986, 95% CI 0.977-0.994), body-mass index (OR = 0.951, 95% CI 0.936-0.965), race (OR = 0.840, 95% CI 0.735-0.960), and sex (OR = 0.561, 95% CI 0.483-0.652) were significantly associated with changes in insulin sensitivity. Conclusion After adjusting for relevant covariates, the daily tobacco consumption at baseline was independently associated with changes in insulin sensitivity. But we were not able to replicate the association between daily alcohol consumption at baseline and changes in insulin resistance reported by other studies. Further studies in different populations and settings are warranted to examine the association between alcohol consumption and changes in insulin resistance.",4,CUREUS INC,PALO ALTO,"PO BOX 61002, PALO ALTO, CA 94306 USA",2168-8184,,CUREUS,Cureus,DEC,2016,8,12,,,UNSP e942,10.7759/cureus.942,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,WOS:000453617500038,28123923,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods and Results-In 4420 young adults in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, we defined a ""metabolic"" risk score based on components of the Third Report of the Adult Treatment Panel's definition of metabolic syndrome. Using latent class trajectory analysis adjusted for sex, race, and time-dependent body mass index, we identified 6 distinct metabolic trajectories over time, specified by initial and final risk: low-stable, low-worsening, high-stable, intermediate-worsening, intermediate-stable, and high-worsening. Overall, individuals gained weight over time in CARDIA with statistically but not clinically different body mass index trend over time. Dysglycemia and dyslipidemia over time were highest in initially high or worsening trajectory groups. Divergence in metabolic trajectories occurred in early adulthood (before age 40), with 2 of 3 individuals experiencing an increase in metabolic risk over time. Membership in a higher-risk trajectory (defined as initially high or worsening over time) was associated with greater prevalence and extent of coronary artery calcification, left ventricular mass, and decreased left ventricular strain at year 25. Importantly, despite similar rise in body mass index across trajectories over 25 years, coronary artery calcification and left ventricular structure and function more closely tracked risk factor trajectories.

Over the study period, 25% (n=184) of those free of CAC in 2000-2001 (n=746) developed detectable CAC. In 2000-2001, median (interquartile range) TMAO was 2.6 (1.8-4.2) mu mol/L. In multivariable-adjusted models, TMAO was not associated with 10-year CAC incidence (rate ratio=1.03; 95% CI: 0.71-1.52) or CAC progression (0.97; 0.68-1.38) in Poisson regression, or cIMT (beta coefficient: -0.009; -0.03 to 0.01) in linear regression, comparing the fourth to the first quartiles of TMAO. Conclusions-In this population-based study, TMAO was not associated with measures of atherosclerosis: CAC incidence, CAC progression, or cIMT. These data indicate that TMAO may not contribute significantly to advancing early atherosclerotic disease risk among healthy early-middle-aged adults.",43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2047-9980,,J AM HEART ASSOC,J.

We examined longitudinal data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study to examine secular trends in total cholesterol, LDL-c, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and triglycerides over 25 years. We also assessed whether modifiable lifestyle factors (body mass index, physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and lipid-lowering medications) are associated with these trends. Methods and Results-CARDIA recruited 5115 black and white men and women ages 18 to 30 years from 4 US communities in 1985-1986, and re-examined them 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years later. Secular trends, modeled as age-matched time trends, were estimated using repeated-measures regression stratified on race and sex. Total cholesterol and LDL-c initially decreased approximate to 5 to 8 mg/dL between visits before plateauing and moving toward adverse trends in all groups, except black women, by year 25. HDL-c showed an upward secular trend of 1 to 3 mg/dL between visits starting at year 15 in all groups; triglyceride trends were largely flat. Obesity and use of lipid-lowering medications, which both increased over follow-up, had strong independent, but opposite, associations with lipid trends over time. In aggregate, associations of modifiable lifestyle factors counterbalanced one another, minimally influencing secular trends. Conclusions-Over 25 years, initially favorable trends in total cholesterol and LDL-c have leveled off and may be reversing, persisting after control for modifiable risk factors.

However, owing to data limitations, there has not been adequate study of the influence of timing and placement of new infrastructure on health over time. Methods: This protocol details methods of the four cities study to perform retrospective field audits in order to capitalize on existing longitudinal health data from the coronary artery risk development in young adults (CARDIA) study. We developed and verified measures of recreation facilities (trails, parks) and transportation infrastructure (bus, light rail, bicycle parking, bicycle paths) in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland, CA (USA). We identify introductions, renovations, and closures between 1985 and 2010 to develop measures of facility and infrastructure change. Ultimately, these data were linked to CARDIA sites' respondents' geographic locations over the 25-year study period to examine associations with health behaviors and outcomes. Results: Data available for retrospective audits was inconsistent by city, primarily due to record-keeping differences. We found large increases in bicycle infrastructure, with the exception of Birmingham, AL, USA. Excluding the addition of a new rail line in Minneapolis, MN, USA, few changes occurred in bus service, rail, and parks.

We examined the association of these biomarkers with incident type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: Analysis of 2339 participants in the community-based coronary artery risk development in young adults (CARDIA) study. Participants (age 40.1 +/- 3.6 years, 44 % Black, 58 % women) were free of diabetes, and were followed 10 years. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for incident T2D adjusting for the other biomarkers under study, demographic and lifestyle measures, dietary biomarkers, BMI (kg/m(2)) and metabolic syndrome components. Results: F2-isoprostanes and oxidized LDL (oxidative stress) were positively associated with incident T2D, but the associations were attenuated by adjustment for BMI. C-reactive protein was positively associated with T2D even with full adjustment: HR (95 % CI) = 2.21 (1.26-3.88) for quartile 4 (Q4) v. quartile 1 (Q1).

The mechanism underlying this association is unknown. Left atrial (LA) size is an important AF risk factor, and studies in older adults suggest Whites have larger LA diameters. However, because AF itself causes LA dilation, LA size differences may be due to greater subclinical AF among older Whites. We therefore assessed for racial differences in LA size among young adults at low AF risk. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study enrolled White and Black participants between 18 and 30 years of age. LA diameter was measured in a subset of participants using echocardiography at Year 5 (n = 4,201) and Year 25 (n = 3,373) of follow up. LA volume was also assessed at Year 5 (n = 2,489). Multivariate linear regression models were used to determine the adjusted association between race and LA size. In unadjusted analyses, mean LA diameter was significantly larger among Blacks compared to Whites both at Year 5 (35.5 +/- 4.8 mm versus 35.1 +/- 4.5 mm, p = 0.01) and Year 25 (37.4 +/- 5.1 mm versus 36.8 +/- 4.9 mm, p = 0.002). After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and echocardiographic parameters, Whites demonstrated an increased LA diameter (0.7 mm larger at Year 5, 95% CI 0.3-1.1, p<0.001; 0.6 mm larger at Year 25, 95% CI 0.3-1.0, p<0.001). There was no significant association between race and adjusted Year 5 LA volume. In conclusion, in a young, well-characterized cohort, the larger adjusted LA diameter among White participants suggests inherent differences in atrial structure may partially explain the higher risk of AF in Whites. The incongruent associations between race, LA diameter, and LA volume suggest that LA geometry, rather than size alone, may have implications for AF risk.",6,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,17-Mar,2016,11,3,,,e0151559,10.1371/journal.pone.0151559,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000372580300086,26985672,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cross-sectional analyses were performed on data from the year 15 examination (2000-2001) including subjects whose depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and had measurements of plasma F2-isoprostanes (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) or serum carotenoids (high-performance liquid chromatography). Carotenoids zeaxanthin/lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene were standardized and summed. Longitudinal analyses were conducted using the data from other examinations at 5-year intervals. Cross-lagged analyses investigated whether CES-D predicted F2-isoprostanes or carotenoids at the following exam, and vice versa. Regression analyses were controlled for sociodemographics, health and lifestyle factors.

In separate multiple-adjusted Cox regression models, the hazard ratio of hypertension per 19.6- mu mol/L (1 SD) higher ascorbic acid was 0.85 (95% CI 0.79-0.92) and per 12-points higher diet score 0.86 (95% CI 0.79-0.94). These hazard ratios changed little with mutual adjustment of ascorbic acid and diet quality score for each other, or when adjusted for anthropometric variables, diabetes, and systolic blood pressure at year 10. Intake of dietary vitamin C and several food groups high in vitamin C content were inversely related to hypertension, whereas supplemental vitamin C was not. In conclusion, plasma ascorbic acid and the a priori diet quality score independently predict hypertension. This suggests that hypertension risk is reduced by improving overall diet quality and/or vitamin C status.

Among the participants with at-risk lifestyle behaviors, 40% reduced alcohol consumption, 14% increased exercise level, 11% stopped smoking, and 8% reached normal weight. While none of the studied patient factors were associated with lifestyle modification, age had a positive impact on antihypertensive medication initiation (p<0.05). We found no evidence of differences in health behavior change between African American and Caucasian participants after receiving the feedback letter. This research is one of the first to study what followed after receiving a feedback letter about elevated blood pressure outside of healthcare settings.

We studied the sUA-CVD association among generally healthy adults. Methods CARDIA recruited 5115 black and white individuals aged 18-30 years in 1985-1986 (year-). Fatal and nonfatal CVD events by year 27 (n = 164) were ascertained during annual contacts and classified using medical records. The association with sUA (year-0, 10, 15 and 20) was modeled using Cox proportional hazards regression, pooling over gender-specific quartiles. Results Mean sUA concentration was higher in men than women, but increased over time in both genders. Those with elevated sUA had worse metabolic profiles that substantially deteriorated over time. Adjusting for demographic and lifestyle factors (the minimal model), baseline sUA concentration was positively associated with incident CVD (hazard ratio (HR) per mg/dL = 1.21; 95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.39; P = 0.005). This positive association attenuated to nonsignificance in the full model accounting simultaneously for classical CVD risk factors (HR = 1.09; 0.94, 1.27; P = 0.24). Both the minimal and full models appeared to show stronger associations (than year-0 sUA) between year-10 sUA and incident CVD (HR = 1.27 and 1.12, respectively), but sUA was not statistically significant in the full model. Despite fewer events, year-15 sUA showed a significant sUA-CVD association pattern, with minimal model association magnitude comparable to year-10, and remained significant in the full model (HR = 1.19; 1.02, 1.40; P = 0.03). Hyperuricemia at year-15 strongly predicted CVD risk (HR = 2.11; 1.34, 3.33; P = 0.001), with some attenuation in the full model (HR = 1.68; P = 0.04).

Method and Results-A total of 3178 black and white women and men in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study were assessed to identify the order in which cardiovascular disease risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or high triglyceride levels), hypercholesterolemia (high total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and obesity develop. Observed patterns of risk factor development were compared with those expected if risk factors accumulated randomly, given their overall distribution in the population. Over the 20 years of follow-up, 80% of participants developed at least 1 risk factor. The first factor to occur was dyslipidemia in 39% of participants, obesity in 20%, hypercholesterolemia in 11%, hypertension in 7%, and diabetes in 1%. Dyslipidemia was the only risk factor both to occur first and to be followed by additional risk factors more often than expected (P<0.001 for both). Order of risk factor accrual did not affect subclinical atherosclerosis at year 20. Results were similar by sex, race, and smoking status.

J,"Poon, VTW; Kuk, JL; Ardern, CI",Trajectories of Metabolic Syndrome Development in Young Adults,PLOS ONE,Article,"Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of metabolic aberrations that collectively increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Greater understanding of MetS developments may provide insight into targeted prevention strategies for individuals at greatest risk. The purpose of this study was to i) identify distinct patterns of longitudinal MetS development and; ii) develop a character profile that differentiates groups by level of MetS risk. Methods and Results: Data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (n = 3 804; 18-30 y) was obtained by limited access application from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and used for this analysis. MetS, as defined by the Harmonized criteria, was assessed over a 20 year follow-up period. Group-level trajectory analysis identified 4 distinct groups with varying rates of component development [No (23.8% of sample); Low (33.5%); Moderate (35.3%); and High MetS (7.4%)]. After adjusting for covariates, individuals in the At-Risk groups (Low, Moderate and High MetS) were more likely to be of black ethnicity (1.37, 1.14-1.66), have a family history of cardiovascular disease (1.61, 1.31-1.97) and history of dieting (1.69, 1.20-2.39) when compared to the No Risk trajectory group (No MetS). Conversely, increasing baseline education (0.76, 0.65-0.89) and aerobic fitness (0.55, 0.47-0.64) was inversely associated with At-Risk group membership.

It is unclear, however, whether GDM increases risk of early atherosclerosis independent of pre-pregnancy obesity and subsequent metabolic disease. Methods and Results-Of 2787 women (18 to 30 years) enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, we studied 898 (47% black) who were free of DM and heart disease at baseline (1985-1986), delivered >= 1 post-baseline births, reported GDM history, and had common carotid intima media thickness (ccIMT, mm) measured in 2005-2006. We used multivariable linear regression to assess associations between GDM and ccIMT adjusted for race, age, parity, and pre-pregnancy cardiometabolic risk factors. We assessed mediators (weight gain, insulin resistance, blood pressure), and effect modification by incident DM or MetS during the 20-year period. Of the 898 women, 119 (13%) reported GDM (7.6 per 100 deliveries). Average age was 31 at last birth and 44 at ccIMT measurement for GDM and non-GDM groups.

However, these reports primarily examine the alpha-tocopherol isoform of vitamin E and have not included the isoform.-tocopherol which we recently demonstrated in vitro opposes the function of a-tocopherol. We previously demonstrated, in vitro and in animal studies, that the vitamin E isoform a-tocopherol protects, but the isoform.-tocopherol promotes lung inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Methods: To translate these findings to humans, we conducted analysis of 4526 adults in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) multi-center cohort with available spirometry and tocopherol data in blacks and whites. Spirometry was obtained at years 0, 5, 10, and 20 and serum tocopherol was from years 0, 7 and 15 of CARDIA. Results: In cross-sectional regression analysis at year 0, higher.-tocopherol associated with lower FEV1 (p = 0.03 in blacks and p = 0.01 in all participants) and FVC (p = 0.01 in blacks, p = 0.05 in whites, and p = 0.005 in all participants), whereas higher a-tocopherol associated with higher FVC (p = 0.04 in blacks and whites and p = 0.01 in all participants). In the lowest quartile of a-tocopherol, higher.-tocopherol associated with a lower FEV1 (p = 0.05 in blacks and p = 0.02 in all participants). In contrast, in the lowest quartile of.-tocopherol, higher a-tocopherol associated with a higher FEV1 (p = 0.03) in blacks.

Conclusion: Increasing serum concentrations of.-tocopherol were associated with lower FEV1 or FVC, whereas increasing serum concentrations of a-tocopherol was associated with higher FEV1 or FVC. Based on the prevalence of serum.-tocopherol > 10 mu M in adults in CARDIA and the adult U.

We included 2903 participants with echocardiography and MRF assessment in follow-up years 5 and 25. At years 5 and 25, LAD was assessed by M-mode echocardiography, then indexed to body surface area (BSA) or height. Blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), heart rate (HR), smoking, alcohol use, diabetes and physical activity were defined as MRF. Associations of MRF with LAD were assessed using multivariable regression adjusted for age, ethnicity, gender and year-5 left atrial (LA) size. Results: The participants were 30+/-4 years; 55% white; 44% men. LAD and LAD/height were modest but significantly higher over the follow-up period, but LAD/BSA decreased slightly. Increased baseline and 20-year changes in BP were related to enlargement of LAD and indices. Higher baseline and changes in BMI were also related to higher LAD and LAD/height, but the opposite direction was found for LAD/BSA. Increase in baseline HR was related to lower LAD but not LAD indices, when only baseline covariates were included in the model. However, baseline and 20-year changes in HR were significantly associated to LA size. Conclusions: In a biracial cohort of young adults, the most robust predictors for LA enlargement over a 20-year follow-up period were higher BP and BMI.

Using regression with fixed effects for individuals, we modeled time-lagged BMI as a function of food and PA resource density (counts per population) and neighborhood development intensity (a composite density score). We controlled for neighborhood poverty, individual-level sociodemographics, and BMI in the prior exam; and included significant interactions between neighborhood measures and by sex. Using model coefficients, we simulated BMI reductions in response to single and combined neighborhood improvements. Simulated increase in supermarket density (from 25th to 75th percentile) predicted inter-exam reduction in BMI of 0.09 kg/m(2) [estimate (95% CI): -0.09 (-0.16, -0.02)]. Increasing commercial PA facility density predicted BMI reductions up to 0.22 kg/m(2) in men, with variation across other neighborhood features [estimate (95% CI) range: -0.14 (-0.29, 0.01) to -0.22 (-0.37, -0.08)]. Simultaneous increases in supermarket and commercial PA facility density predicted inter-exam BMI reductions up to 0.31 kg/m(2) in men [estimate (95% CI) range: -0.23 (-0.39, -0.06) to -0.31 (-0.47, -0.15)] but not women.

Sequencing pooled samples can reduce the cost, but detecting rare variants and identifying individual carriers is difficult and requires additional experiments. To address these issues, we have developed a rare variant-detection algorithm V-Sieve to screen for rare alleles in pooled DNA samples which, in combination with a unique pooling strategy, is able to efficiently screen a candidate gene for idiosyncratic variants in thousands of samples. We applied this method to 2283 individuals, and identified > 100 polymorphisms in the C-reactive protein locus at an allele frequency as low as 0.02%, with a positive predictive rate of 93%. We believe this algorithm will be useful in both screening for rare variants in genomic regions known to associate with particular phenotypes and in replicating rare variant associations identified in large-scale studies, such as exome re-sequencing projects.",3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-1048,1362-4962,NUCLEIC ACIDS RES,Nucleic Acids Res.,APR,2013,41,7,,,e85,10.1093/nar/gkt092,15,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,WOS:000318167900012,23408856,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested this hypothesis in a bi-racial cohort of younger African-American and white men and women. Methods: Data from 5,049 participants at the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort baseline (1985 to1986) and follow-up for up to 20 years of individuals without hyperuricemia (defined as a serum urate of 6.8 mg/dL or more) at baseline were utilized.

Confounding factors examined included: age at enrollment, body mass index, development of hypertension, glomerular filtration rate, medication use, diet and alcohol intake and menopausal symptoms in women. Results: Referent to whites, African-American men and women had significantly lower concentrations of serum urate at baseline. African-American men had an essentially equal risk of developing incident hyperuricemia during follow-up compared with white men (multivariable adjusted HR = 1.12 (0.88 to1.40)).

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether several POPs prospectively predict type 2 diabetes within the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort. METHODS: Participants in this nested case-control study were diabetes free in 1987-1988. By 2005-2006, the 90 controls remained free of diabetes, whereas the 90 cases developed diabetes. Using serum collected in 1987-1988, we measured 8 organochlorine pesticides, 22 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs), and 1 polybrominated biphenyl (PBB). We compared POP concentrations from CARDIA and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2003-2004. We computed odds ratios (ORs) for incident diabetes using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Chlorinated POPs in CARDIA in 1987-1988 were much higher than corresponding NHANES 2003-2004 concentrations. POPs showed nonlinear associations with diabetes risk. The highest risk was observed in the second quartiles of trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, mirex, highly chlorinated PCBs, and PBB153-a finding that suggests low-dose effects. We concentrated risk by summing these POPs and isolated very low concentrations of multiple POPs in the lowest sextile of the sum. The adjusted OR in the second sextile vs. the lowest sextile was 5.3 overall and 20.1 for body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2).

Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by elevated levels of CRP and IL-6, but the relationship between cardiac vagal activity and cytokine levels in healthy humans is not well understood.

To what extent are these relationships gendered? Do socioeconomic characteristics, stressors, and discrimination help explain the skin color-health relationship? The findings indicate that dark-skinned women experience more physiological deterioration and self-report worse health than lighter skinned women. These associations are not evident among men, and socioeconomic factors, stressors, and discrimination do not explain the dark-light disparity in physiological deterioration among women. Differences in self-ratings of health among women, however, are generally explained by education and income.

We aimed to study the association of CAC in middle age and change in CAC from early adulthood to middle age with left ventricular (LV) function. Methods: CAC score was measured by computed tomography at CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) year-15 examination and at year-25 examination (Y25) in 3043 and 3189 participants, respectively. CAC score was assessed as a continuous variable and log-transformed to account for nonlinearity. Change in CAC from year-15 examination to Y25 was evaluated as the absolute difference of log-transformed CAC from year-15 examination to Y25. LV structure and function were evaluated by echocardiography at Y25. Results: At Y25, mean age was 50.1 +/- 3.6 years, 56.6% women, 52.4% black. In the multivariable analysis at Y25, higher CAC was related to higher LV mass (beta=1.218; adjusted P=0.007), higher LV end-diastolic volume (beta=0.811; adjusted P=0.007), higher LV end-systolic volume (beta=0.350; adjusted P=0.048), higher left atrial volume (beta=0.214; adjusted P=0.009), and higher E/e ' ratio (beta=0.059; adjusted P=0.014). CAC was measured at both year-15 examination and Y25 in 2449 individuals. Higher change in CAC score during follow-up was independently related to higher LV mass index in blacks (beta=4.789; adjusted P<0.001), but not in whites (beta=1.051; adjusted P=0.283). Conclusions: Higher CAC in middle age is associated with higher LV mass and volumes and worse LV diastolic function.

We examined risk factors contributing to differences between biological and chronological heart age in young adults. Methods: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study included 2264 Black and White men and women who attended examination years 10 through 25. We estimated biological heart age using the nonlaboratory-based Framingham 10-year cardiovascular disease risk calculator. Trends in risk factors were examined cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Results: Biological heart ages for Black participants were 5.6 years older than their chronological ages over 15 years (P <.001). In longitudinal analyses, urinary albumin creatinine ratio and alcohol intake were statistically significantly related to higher biological compared with chronological heart age, whereas physical activity and education were statistically significantly related to negative heart age differences (P <.001). Trends were similar in cross-sectional analyses at all time points. Conclusions: Most risk factors driving biological heart age, including race, education, physical activity, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, contributed to heart age differences cross-sectionally and longitudinally suggesting that risk factors related to adverse biological aging are important at younger and older ages.

Methods: In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, we modeled trajectories of depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale [CES-D]) and smoking (cigarettes per day [CPD]) among 3614 adults followed fromyear 0 (ages 18-30 years) through year 15 (ages 33-45 years). Biomarkers of inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, F2-isoprostanes), and endothelial dysfunction (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1, soluble P-selectin) were assessed at year 15. We conducted separate linear regression analyses with CES-D trajectory, CPD trajectory, and their interaction with each of the five biomarkers. Results: The sample was 56% women, 47% black, and 40 years old on average at year 15. The CES-D trajectory by CPD trajectory interaction was not associated with any of the biomarkers (all p's >.01). Removing the interaction term, CES-D trajectory was associated with inflammation: higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were observed in the subthreshold (beta = 0.57, p =.004) and increasing depressive symptoms (beta = 1.36, p <.001) trajectories compared with the no depression trajectory. CPD trajectory was associated with oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction: compared with never smokers, heavy smokers had significantly higher levels of F2-isoprostanes (beta = 6.20, p =.001), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (beta = 24.98, p <.001), and soluble P-selectin (beta = 2.91, p <.001).

Methods: We used data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study (baseline: 1985-1986). Echocardiography was performed after 25 (Y25) and 30 years of follow-up. Group-based modeling was used to determine 25-year trajectories in FG and IR. We assessed differences at Y25 and 5-year longitudinal change in cardiac structure and function after adjustment for demographics, cumulative exposure to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and baseline FG or IR. Results: We identified five FG trajectory groups among 2414 individuals and three IR trajectory groups among 2358 individuals. Moderate-increasing FG trajectory was associated with lower lateral E' velocity (difference: -0.9 cm/s, 95%Cl: -0.3, -1.5) and with greater left ventricular (LV) mass index (difference: 2.7 g/m(2.7), 95% CI: 0.7, 4.7) at Y30 compared to low-stable FG. High-increasing IR trajectory was associated with lower lateral E' velocity and septal E' velocity at Y30 compared to low-decreasing IR trajectory.

Methods: Participants (N = 3231) from the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study underwent baseline examination and were reexamined in eight follow-up visits. Diet was assessed at baseline and in exam years 7 and 20. Toenail Hg and Se were measured at exam year 2. Cognitive function was measured at exam year 25 using three tests: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and the Stroop test. The general linear regression model was used to examine cumulative average intakes of LC omega-3 PUFA and seafood in relation to the cognitive test scores; and to explore the possible effect modifications caused by Hg and Se. Results: LC omega-3 PUFA intake was significantly associated with better performance in the DSST test (quintile 5 versus quintile 1; mean difference =1.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-3.29; P-trend, 0.048]), but not in the RAVLT and Stroop tests. Similar results were observed for intakes of eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and non-fried seafood. The observed associations were more pronounced in participants with body mass index >25 kg/m(2), but not significantly modified by toenail Hg or Se. Conclusion: This longitudinal study supported the hypothesis that LC omega-3 PUFA or non-fried seafood intake is associated with better cognitive performance in psychomotor speed among US adults, especially those who are overweight or obese.

Methods From the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, an observational cohort study, we included 2316 participants (mean age = 45.2 3.6 yr at year 20, 57% female, 43% Black) with HRV measured in 2005-2006 (year 20) and graded exercise test duration (GXTd) and adiposity measures (body mass index and waist circumference) obtained in 1985-1986 (baseline) and 2005-2006. HRV measures (SD of all normal RR intervals [SDNN] and square root of the mean value of the squares of differences between all successive RR intervals [RMSSD]) were obtained from resting 30-s 12-lead ECG. Cross-sectional associations between GXTd, adiposity, and HRV were assessed at year 20. Longitudinal changes in GXTd and adiposity measures were categorized as 10% increase, <10% change (no change), or 10% decrease. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess associations of GXTd and adiposity measures with unfavorable versus more favorable HRV (lower 25th percentile vs upper 75th percentile). Results A 1-SD increment in GXTd was associated with 22% and 32% lower odds of unfavorable SDNN and RMSSD, respectively; associations remained significant after adjustment for adiposity. A 1-SD increment in adiposity measures was associated with 16%-28% higher odds of unfavorable RMSSD; associations were not significant after adjustment for GXTd. Compared with no change/increase in GXTd, longitudinal decrease in GXTd was significantly associated with 55% and 94% higher odds of unfavorable SDNN and RMSSD, respectively, at year 20. These associations remained significant after adjusting for adiposity. Conclusion Cardiorespiratory fitness may be a stronger determinant of HRV than adiposity.

Age-specific racial differences in maintaining health behaviors from ages 18 to 50 years were determined. Methods: In 1985-1986, the population-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study enrolled 5,115 participants aged 18-30 years. In 2017, a total of 2,485 blacks and 2,407 whites with one or more optimal health behaviors at baseline who attended one or more of seven follow-up exams over 25 years (i.e., through 2010-2011) were analyzed. The primary outcome, maintaining four or more optimal health behaviors, included BMI <25; never smoking; >= 150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity; no/moderate alcohol intake (women/men: zero to seven/zero to 14 drinks per week); and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet adherence score >= 15 (i.e., baseline highest quartile).

We hypothesized that a longer duration of lactation would be associated with lower prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the United States. Methods: Participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort study who delivered >= 1 child post-baseline (Y0: 1985-1986), and underwent CT quantification of hepatic steatosis 25 years following cohort entry (Y25: 2010-2011) were included (n = 844). The duration of lactation was summed for all post-baseline births, and NAFLD at Y25 was assessed by central review of CT images and defined by liver attenuation <= 40 Hounsfield Units after exclusion of other causes of hepatic steatosis. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed using an a priori set of confounding variables; age, race, education, and baseline body mass index. Results: Of 844 women who delivered after baseline (48% black, 52% white, mean age 49 years at Y25 exam), 32% reported lactation duration of 0 to 1 month, 25% reported > 1 to 6 months, 43% reported more than 6 months, while 54 (6%) had NAFLD. Longer lactation duration was inversely associated with NAFLD in unadjusted logistic regression. For women who reported > 6 months lactation compared to those reporting 0-1 month, the odds ratio for NAFLD was 0.48 (95% CI 0.25-0.94; p = 0.03) and the association remained after adjustment for confounders (adjusted odds ratio 0.46; 95% CI 0.22-0.97; p = 0.04). Conclusions: A longer duration of lactation, particularly greater than 6 months, is associated with lower odds of NAFLD in mid-life and may represent a modifiable risk factor for NAFLD. Lay summary: A longer duration of breastfeeding has been associated with multiple potential health benefits for the mother including reduction in heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. In this study we found that breastfeeding for longer than 6 months was associated with a lower risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mid-life.

J,"Hargrove, TW","BMI Trajectories in Adulthood: The Intersection of Skin Color, Gender, and Age among African Americans",JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR,Article,"This study addresses three research questions critical to understanding if and how skin color shapes health among African Americans: (1) Does skin color predict trajectories of body mass index (BMI) among African Americans across ages 32 to 55? (2) To what extent is this relationship contingent on gender? (3) Do sociodemographic, psychosocial, and behavioral factors explain the skin color-BMI relationship? Using data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study and growth curve models, results indicate that dark-skinned women have the highest BMI across adulthood compared to all other skin color-gender groups. BMI differences between dark- and lighter-skinned women remain stable from ages 32 to 55. Among men, a BMI disadvantage emerges and widens between light- and dark-skinned men and their medium-skinned counterparts. Observed sociodemographic characteristics, stressors, and health behaviors do not explain these associations.

Methods: Participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, a multicenter, population-based cohort, underwent repeated anthropometric assessment (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio) from examination years 0 to 25. At year 25, longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain and tissue Doppler velocities were assessed by echocardiography. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify 25-year trajectories of change in anthropometric measures and to examine associations between trajectories of adiposity change and indices of cardiac mechanics. Results: Among 3,310 participants, four distinct trajectories of BMI change were identified: stable BMI (36% of the cohort; mean Delta BMI, 1.6 kg/m(2)), mild increase (40%; mean Delta BMI, 6.0 kg/m(2)), moderate increase (18%; mean Delta BMI, 10.8 kg/m(2)), and major increase (6%; mean Delta BMI, 15.5 kg/m(2)). Trajectories of greater BMI increase were associated with lower adjusted e' velocity and higher E/e' ratio compared with the stable BMI group, independent of year 0 or year 25 BMI. Participants in increasing BMI trajectory groups compared with the stable BMI group had lower absolute longitudinal strain and greater odds of diastolic dysfunction, independent of year 0 BMI but not year 25 BMI. Similar patterns were observed for change in waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio trajectory groups. Conclusions: Steeper trajectories of BMI increase from young adulthood to middle age, a vulnerable period for weight gain, are independently associated with lower e' velocity and higher E/e' ratio, but not systolic dysfunction, in midlife.",7,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0894-7317,,J AM SOC ECHOCARDIOG,J.

We assessed temporal trajectories of insulin resistance and -cell response to serum glucose concentration throughout adulthood and their association with diabetes risk in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. MethodsResultsThree thousand and sixty participants from Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults, a prospective bi-racial cohort of adults age 18-30years at baseline (1985-1986; Y0) who completed up to 5 exams over 25years and had fasting insulin and glucose measurement were included. At Y25 (2010-2011), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was assessed by noncontrast computed tomography after exclusion of other liver fat causes. Latent mixture modelling identified 25-year trajectories in homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance and -cell response homeostatic model assessment-. Three distinct trajectories were identified, separately, for homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (low-stable [47%]; moderate-increasing [42%]; and high-increasing [12%]) and homeostatic model assessment- (low-decreasing [16%]; moderate-decreasing [63%]; and high-decreasing [21%]). Y25 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease prevalence was 24.5%. Among non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, high-increasing homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (referent: low-stable) was associated with greater prevalent (OR 95% CI=8.0, 2.0-31.9) and incident (OR=10.5, 2.6-32.8) diabetes after multivariable adjustment including Y0 or Y25 homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance. In contrast, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease participants with low-decreasing homeostatic model assessment- (referent: high-decreasing) had the highest odds of prevalent (OR=14.1, 3.9-50.9) and incident (OR=10.3, 2.7-39.3) diabetes. ConclusionTrajectories of insulin resistance and -cell response during young and middle adulthood are robustly associated with diabetes risk in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

However, prior studies lacked detailed information on individual-level factors (eg, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics) that could potentially confound associations. Our objective was to estimate associations of smoke-free policies with incident cardiovascular disease in a longitudinal cohort after controlling for sociodemographics, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and policy covariates. Methods: Longitudinal data from 3783 black and white adults in the CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults; 1995-2015) were linked to state, county, and local 100% smoke-free policies in bars, restaurants, and nonhospitality workplaces by Census tract. Extended Cox regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of incident cardiovascular disease associated with time-dependent smoke-free policy exposures. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, cardiovascular disease risk factors, state cigarette tax, participant-reported presence of a smoking ban at their workplace, field center, and metropolitan statistical area poverty. Results: During a median follow-up of 20 years (68332 total person-years), 172 participants had an incident cardiovascular disease event (2.5 per 1000 person-years). Over the follow-up period, 80% of participants lived in areas with smoke-free policies in restaurants, 67% in bars, and 65% in nonhospitality workplaces. In fully adjusted models, participants living in an area with a restaurant, bar, or workplace smoke-free policy had a lower risk of incident cardiovascular disease compared with those in areas without smoke-free policies (HR, 0.75, 95% confidence interval, 0.49-1.15; HR, 0.76, 95% confidence interval, 0.47-1.24; HR, 0.54, 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.86, respectively; HR, 0.58, 95% confidence interval, 0.33-1.00 for living in an area with all 3 types of policies compared with none). The estimated preventive fraction was 25% for restaurant policies, 24% for bar policies, and 46% for workplace policies.

Methods Participants were 1333 women enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study who did not have diabetes either at baseline (1985-86) or before births occurring after baseline. Baseline fitness was estimated using a graded symptom-limited maximal exercise treadmill test and expressed in MET units. Baseline MVPA (exercise units per day) was measured using the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults physical activity history questionnaire, and television viewing (hd(-1)) was assessed by self-report in 1990-1991. Logistic regression analysis was used to derive odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for time from baseline to delivery and baseline study center, age, race, education, parity, family history of diabetes, smoking, alcohol, saturated fat intake, waist circumference, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and HDL cholesterol. Results Over 25 yr of follow-up, 164 women developed GDM. The odds of developing GDM were 21% lower for each 1 SD increment in baseline level of fitness (2.3 METs, odds ratio = 0.79, 95% confidence interval = 0.65-0.96). Prepregnancy MVPA and television viewing were not statistically associated with the development of GDM.

However, the association of BP trajectories during young adulthood with subsequent decline in kidney function has not been well defined. Study Design: Observational cohort study. Setting & Participants: 3,429 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adulthood (CARDIA) Study enrolled between the ages of 18 and 30 years. Predictors: BP slope during the first 10 years of participation in CARDIA, derived from linear mixed models incorporating all repeated BP measures. Outcome: Decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during the interval between years 10 and 20 of CARDIA participation using cystatin C measured at years 10, 15, and 20. Results; Mean age of CARDIA participants at year 0 was 25.1 years, 56% were women, and 53% were white. Every 10-mm Hg higher level of systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) in year 10 was associated with change in eGFR of -0.09 (95% CI, -0.13 to -0.06) and -0.07 (95% CI, -0.12 to -0.03) mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year, respectively.

A better understanding of these differences may help identify intervention targets for reducing cardiovascular disease disparities. This study examined whether socioeconomic, psychosocial, and neighborhood environmental factors, in isolation or together, mediate racial differences in health behaviors. Methods: Participants were 3,081 men and women from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study who were enrolled in 1985-1986 (Year 0) and completed a follow-up examination in 2015-2016 (Year 30). A health behavior score was created at Years 0, 7, 20, and 30 using smoking, physical activity, and diet assessed that year. The race difference in health behavior score was estimated using linear regression in serial cross-sectional analyses. Mediation analyses computed the proportion of the race and health behavior score association attributable to socioeconomic, psychosocial, and neighborhood factors. Results: Data analysis conducted in 2016-2017 found that blacks had significantly lower health behavior scores than whites across 30 years of follow-up. Individual socioeconomic factors mediated 48.9%-70.1% of the association between race and health behavior score, psychosocial factors 20.3%30.0%, and neighborhood factors 22.1%-41.4% < 0.01 for all). Conclusions: Racial differences in health behavior scores appear to be mediated predominately by correspondingly large differences in socioeconomic factors. This study highlights the profound impact of socioeconomic factors, which are mostly not under an individual's control, on health behaviors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors may help reduce disparities in health behaviors. (C) 2018 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Summary of Background Data: Living kidney donor selection practices have evolved from examining individual risk factors to a risk calculator incorporating multiple characteristics. Owing to limited long-term data and lack of genetic information, current risk tools lack precision among young potential living kidney donors, particularly African Americans (AAs). Methods: We identified a cohort of young adults (18-30 years) with no absolute contraindication to kidney donation from the longitudinal cohort study Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults. Risk associations for CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) were identified and assigned weighted points to calculate risk scores. Results: A total of 3438 healthy adults were identified [mean age 24.8 years; 48.3% AA; median follow-up 24.9 years (interquartile range: 24.5-25.2)]. For 18-year olds, 25-year projected CKD risk varied by ethnicity and sex even without baseline clinical and genetic abnormalities; risk was 0.30% for European American (EA) women, 0.52% for EA men, 0.52% for AA women, 0.90% for AA men. Among 18-year-old AAs with apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants without baseline abnormalities, 25-year risk significantly increased: 1.46% for women and 2.53% for men; among those with 2 APOL1 renal-risk variants and baseline abnormalities, 25-year risk was higher: 2.53% to 6.23% for women and 4.35% to 10.58% for men.

Methods: We studied 87 Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) participants 48-60 yr of age who simultaneously wore the 7164 and wGT3X-BT accelerometers at the waist in 2015-2016, with wear time of 4 of 7 d, 10 hd(-1) for both monitors. Freedson cutpoints (counts per minute) were used to define sedentary (<100), light (100-1951), moderate (1952-5724), and vigorous activity (5725). Agreement was evaluated using paired-difference tests, intraclass correlation coefficients, and Bland-Altman plots. Given systematic differences in count-based estimates between monitors, a calibration formula applied to the wGT3X-BT values was obtained by linear regression. Results: Total detected wear time minutes per day was nearly identical between the 7164 and the wGT3X-BT (881.5 70.9 vs 880.3 +/- 78.1, P = 0.72). The wGT3X-BT values were calibrated to the 7164 values by dividing counts by 1.088. After calibration, no differences were observed between the 7164 and the wGT3X-BT in total counts per day (310,184 +/- 129,189 vs 307,085 +/- 135,362, P = 0.48), average counts per min per day (349.5 +/- 139.5 vs 346.5 +/- 147.2, P = 0.54), sedentary (513.2 +/- 93.6 vs 509.6 +/- 98.6, P = 0.23), light (335.3 +/- 81.5 vs 338.7 +/- 81.1, P = 0.22), moderate (31.0 +/- 21.9 vs 30.3 +/- 23.4, P = 0.31), or moderate-to-vigorous minutes per day (33.1 +/- 24.6 vs 32.0 +/- 26.0, P = 0.13). A significant difference was observed for vigorous minutes per day (0.2 +/- 1.0 vs 0.0 +/- 0.3, P < 0.01); however, the absolute difference was marginal. Intraclass correlation coefficients showed excellent agreement for all measures (0.95-0.99). Conclusions: After applying a calibration formula, the 7164 and wGT3X-BT were comparable for total wear time, count-based estimates, and average minutes per day in sedentary, light, moderate, and moderate-to-vigorous activity.

However, concentrations of biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction before pregnancy have rarely been measured. We hypothesized that higher levels of biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction (cellular adhesion molecules and selectins) would be associated with odds of preterm birth and/or small-for-gestational-age deliveries. We included 235 women from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who were nulliparous at Y7, reported >= 1 live birth through Y25, and had >= 1 biomarker measured at Y7. We tested for associations between individual biomarkers and an averaged z-score representing total endothelial dysfunction with preterm birth and/or small-for-gestational-age deliveries using Poisson regression, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics at the exam immediately preceding index birth. At Y7, total evidence of endothelial dysfunction was similar in women who did (n = 59) and did not have (n = 176) preterm birth and/or small-for-gestational-age deliveries.

However, these findings were limited to older individuals with high comorbidities. To evaluate this in younger individuals, we calculated associations of APOL1 risk variants (high risk [2 risk variants] vs. low risk [0-1 risk variant]) with prevalent, incident, or progressive coronary artery calcification, a carotid intima media thickness over the 90th percentile, and left ventricular hypertrophy in 1315 black participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. The mean age of this cohort was 44.6 years and their mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 102.5 ml/min/1.73m(2). High-risk participants were found to be younger and have a higher prevalence of albuminuria than low-risk participants. In Poisson regression models adjusted for comorbidities and kidney function, the risk of prevalent coronary artery calcification (relative risk [95% confidence interval] 1.12 [0.72,1.71]), the incident coronary artery calcification (1.50 [0.87,2.59]), and the progression of coronary artery calcification (1.40 [0.88,2.23]) did not significantly differ in high vs. low-risk participants. Furthermore, the risk of carotid intima media thickness over the 90th percentile (1.28 [0.78,2.10]) and left ventricular hypertrophy (1.02[0.73,1.43]) did not significantly differ in high vs. low-risk participants in fully-adjusted models.

We evaluated whether GDM is associated with incident chronic kidney disease (CKD), controlling for prepregnancy risk factors for both conditions. Study Design: Prospective cohort. Setting & Participants: Of 2,747 women (aged 18-30 years) enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study in 1985 to 86, we studied 820 who were nulliparous at enrollment, delivered at least 1 pregnancy longer than 20 weeks' gestation, and had kidney function measurements during 25 years of follow-up. Predictor: GDM was self-reported by women for each pregnancy. Outcomes: CKD was defined as the development of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or urine albumin-creatinine ratio >= 25 mg/g at any one CARDIA examination in years 10, 15, 20, or 25.

Objective To examine the bidirectional longitudinal associations between rapid decline in lung function and adiposity phenotypes in healthy adults. Methods This secondary analysis used a 25-year longitudinal dataset from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study that enrolled 5115 participants. Measurements In the first analysis, metabolic syndrome at or before CARDIA year (Y) 10 (Y10) was the predictor, and subsequent rapid decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) or forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) between Y10 and Y20 was the outcome. In the second analysis, rapid decline was the predictor, and incident metabolic syndrome at Y20 and/or Y25 was the outcome. In the third analysis, rapid decline was the predictor, and subsequent CT-assessed regional fat depots at Y25 were the outcome. Results Metabolic syndrome at or before Y10 is temporally associated with rapid decline in FVC between Y10 and Y20 (adjusted p= 0.04), but this association was explained by body mass index (BMI) at Y10. Rapid decline in FVC or FEV 1 is temporally associated with greater incident metabolic syndrome at Y20 and/or Y25 (adjusted OR 2.10 (1.69, 2.61); p< 0.001, and 1.56 (1.26, 1.94); p< 0.001, respectively) and greater CT-assessed intrathoracic visceral adiposity at Y25 (adjusted standardised beta 0.09; p< 0.001 for both analyses). These associations were not explained by BMI levels prior to the outcome measurement. Conclusions Healthy adults with rapid decline in lung function are at risk for developing metabolic syndrome and for disproportionate accumulation of intrathoracic visceral fat.

Methods: Included were Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study participants (N = 2,933) aged 23 to 35 years with available transthoracic echocardiographic measurements during 20 years of follow-up. Multivariate linear regression models assessed sex-specific associations between 20-year change in aortic root diameter with LV structure and function.

In longitudinal analyses, increase in aortic root diameter over 20-year follow-up was associated with a greater 20-year increase in LV mass and ratio of LV mass to LV end-diastolic volume ratio in both sexes.

Methods We used 20 years (1985-1986, 1992-1993 2005-2006) of data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study across four US cities (Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Oakland, California) and instrumental variables (IV) regression to obtain causal estimates of longitudinal associations between the percentage of neighbourhood food outlets (per total food outlets within 1 km network distance of respondent residence) and an a priori diet quality score, with higher scores indicating higher diet quality. To assess the presence and magnitude of bias related to residual confounding, we compared results from causal models (IV regression) to non-causal models, including ordinary least squares regression, which does not account for residual confounding at all and fixed-effects regression, which only controls for time-invariant unmeasured characteristics. Results The mean diet quality score across follow-up was 63.4 (SD=12.7). A 10% increase in fast food restaurants (relative to full-service restaurants) was associated with a lower diet quality score over time using IV regression (beta =-1.01, 95% CI -1.99 to -0.04); estimates were attenuated using non-causal models. The percentage of neighbourhood convenience and grocery stores (relative to supermarkets) was not associated with diet quality in any model, but estimates from non-causal models were similarly attenuated compared with causal models.

Methods: We studied 825 premenopausal women from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study in 1990 to 1991 (baseline, mean age 32 years) who later reached menopause by 2010 to 2011 and had echocardiograms at these two time points. Results: During 20 years of follow-up, 508 women reached NM, whereas 317 underwent SM (34% had bilateral oophorectomy). At baseline, women who later underwent SM were more likely to be black, younger, have greater parity, and higher mean values of systolic blood pressure, body mass index, and also lower mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and physical activity than women who reached NM. No significant differences in LV structure/function were found between groups. In 2010 to 2011, SM women had significantly higher LV mass, LV mass/volume ratio, E/e' ratio, and impaired longitudinal and circumferential strain than NM women. SM women with bilateral oophorectomy had adverse LV measures than women with hysterectomy with ovarian conservation. Controlling for baseline echocardiographic parameters and CVDRF in linear regression models eliminated these differences between groups. Further adjustment for age at menopause/surgery and hormone therapy use did not change these results. Conclusion: In this study, the adverse LV structure and function observed among women with SM compared with NM were explained by their unfavorable presurgical CVDRF profiles, suggesting that premenopausal CVDRF rather than gynecologic surgery predispose SM women to elevated future cardiovascular disease risk.",3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1072-3714,1530-0374,MENOPAUSE,Menopause-J.

Patients and Methods: This study includes 3175 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who self-reported PA by questionnaire at 8 follow-up examinations over 25 years (from March 1985-June 1986 through June 2010-May 2011). The presence of CAC (CAC>0) at year 25 was measured using computed tomography. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify PA trajectories with increasing age. Results: We identified 3 distinct PA trajectories: trajectory 1, below PA guidelines (n=1813; 57.1%); trajectory 2, meeting PA guidelines (n = 1094; 34.5%); and trajectory 3, 3 times PA guidelines (n = 268; 8.4%). Trajectory 3 participants had higher adjusted odds of CAC>0 (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 95% CI, 0.95-1.70) vs those in trajectory 1. Stratification by race showed that white participants who engaged in PA 3 times the guidelines had higher odds of developing CAC>0 (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.21-2.67). Further stratification by sex showed higher odds for white males (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.16-2.98), and similar but nonsignificant trends were noted for white females (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 0.79-3.71). However, no such higher odds of CAC>0 for trajectory 3 were observed for black participants. Conclusion: White individuals who participated in 3 times the recommended PA guidelines over 25 years had higher odds of developing coronary subclinical atherosclerosis by middle age. These findings warrant further exploration, especially by race, into possible biological mechanisms for CAC risk at very high levels of PA.

Moderate drinking (vs abstinence) is associated with lower risk of CVD in the general population. We assessed whether alcohol use is associated with CVD risk in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: We analyzed data from participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults longitudinal cohort study of 5115 black and white young adults, 18-30 years old, recruited from 4 cities in the United States from 1985 through 1986. Participants self-reported alcohol use at study entry and then again after 15, 20, and 25 years. At year 25 (2010-2011), participants underwent computed tomography examination of the thorax and abdomen and tissue Doppler echocardiography with myocardial strain measured by speckle tracking. Coronary artery calcification was defined as an Agatston score above 0. NAFLD was defined as liver attenuation < 51 Hounsfield Units after exclusions. Drinkers reported 1-21 (men) or 1-14 (women) standard drinks/week at years 15, 20, or 25. Nondrinkers reported no alcohol use at years 15, 20, and 25. RESULTS: Of the 570 participants with NAFLD (mean age, 50 years; 54% black; 46% female), 332 (58%) were drinkers; significantly higher proportions of drinkers were white, male, and with higher levels of education compared with nondrinkers (P < .05 for all). Higher proportions of drinkers had obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome compared with nondrinkers (P < .01). There was no difference in liver attenuation between groups (P = .12). After multivariable adjustment, there was no association between alcohol use and CVD risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) or subclinical CVD measures (coronary artery calcification, early transmitral velocity/late (atrial) transmitral velocity (E/A) ratio, global longitudinal strain). CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based sample of individuals with NAFLD in midlife, prospectively assessed alcohol use is not associated with significant differences in risk factors for CVD or markers of subclinical CVD. In contrast to general population findings, alcohol use may not reduce the risk of CVD in patients with NAFLD.",17,W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC,PHILADELPHIA,"1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA",0016-5085,1528-0012,GASTROENTEROLOGY,Gastroenterology,NOV,2017,153,5,1260,+,,10.1053/j.gastro.2017.08.012,16,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,WOS:000414348400027,28802566,Green Accepted,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess this we evaluated whether self-reported race and, in blacks, APOL1 risk variants (high-risk [2 risk alleles] versus low-risk [0-1 risk allele]) were associated with longitudinal blood pressure. Blood pressure trajectories were determined using linear mixed-effects (slope) and latent class models (5 distinct groups) during 25 years of follow-up in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. Associations of race and APOL1 genotypes with blood pressure change, separately, using linear mixed-effects and multinomial logistic regression models, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and traditional hypertension risk factors, anti-hypertensive medication use, and kidney function were evaluated. Among 1700 whites and 1330 blacks (13% APOL1 high-risk, mean age 25 years; 46% male) mean mid-, ([systolic + diastolic blood pressure]/2), systolic, and diastolic blood pressures were 89, 110, and 69 mm Hg, respectively. One percent of participants used anti-hypertensive medications at baseline. Compared to whites, blacks, regardless of APOL1 genotype, had significantly greater increases in mid-blood pressure and were more likely to experience significantly increasing mid-blood pressure trajectories with adjusted relative risk ratios of 5.21 and 7.27 for moderate-increasing and elevated-increasing versus low-stable blood pressure, respectively. Among blacks, longitudinal mid-blood pressure changes and mid-blood pressure trajectory classification were similar by APOL1 risk status. Modeling systolic and diastolic blood pressure as outcomes yielded similar findings. From young adulthood to mid-life, blacks have greater blood pressure increases versus whites that are not fully explained by traditional risk factors.

Study design: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA) Women's Study was an ancillary study to CARDIA, a population-based study of adults aged 18-30 years followed for 3 decades. For this report, participants were women (n = 426) who had attended the CARDIA year 15-16 (2000-2001) examination, had at least one ovary, were not pregnant, and underwent serum AMH and FSH measurement and transvaginal ultrasonography in 2002-2003. Main outcome measures: The probability of menopause in 5 years based upon AMH, FSH, and AFC. Results: The mean age of the women at the time of AMH, FSH, and AFC assessment was 43 years. The cumulative incidence of menopause at 25 years (or follow-up) was 27% (n = 426), and the incidence within 5 years was 13% (n = 55). Among women aged 45-49 years, undetectable AMH concentrations were associated with a greater than 60% probability of menopause within 5 years, whereas approximately 1/3 of women with no or just one antral follicle experienced menopause within 5 years. Both low and high concentrations of FSH were associated with greater odds of menopause than intermediate concentrations.

The aim of this study was to assess reference ranges and regional patterns of LV strain and strain rate using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography in a large population of black and white subjects. Methods: This study involved a retrospective review of prospectively collected images in 557 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study who remained healthy at the year 25 examination. LV deformation parameters were measured in apical four-chamber, apical two-chamber, and parasternal short-axis views in 509, 391, and 521 subjects, respectively. Results: Patients' mean age was 49.6 +/- 3.6 years, 61.6% were women, and 69.5% were white.

Whether testosterone (the predominant androgen) is associated with NAFLD independent of metabolic co-factors is unclear. Additionally, whether testosterone confers increased risk of NAFLD in women without hyperandrogenism is unknown. METHODS: Among women in the prospective population-based multicenter Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, we assessed whether free testosterone levels measured at Year 2 (1987-1988) were associated with prevalent NAFLD at Year 25 (2010-2011) (n=1052). NAFLD was defined using noncontrast abdominal CT scan with liver attenuation <= 40 Hounsfield units after excluding other causes of hepatic fat. The association of free testosterone with prevalent NAFLD was assessed by logistic regression. RESULTS: Increasing quintiles of free testosterone were associated with prevalent NAFLD at Year 25 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.50, P=0.015), independent of insulin resistance, body mass index, waist circumference, and serum lipids. Importantly, the association persisted among n=955 women without androgen excess (AOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05-1.53, P=0.016). Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume partially mediated the association of free testosterone with NAFLD (mediating effect 41.0%, 95% CI 22-119%). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing free testosterone is associated with prevalent NAFLD in middle age, even in women without androgen excess. Visceral adiposity appears to play an important role in the relationship between testosterone and NAFLD in women.

Few studies have prospectively evaluated the association between depressive symptom clusters and risk of CVD. Previously, we observed that smoking and global depressive symptoms were synergistically associated with coronary artery calcification (CAC). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the smoking by depressive symptoms interaction, measured cumulatively over 25 years, differed by depressive symptom cluster (negative affect, anhedonia, and somatic symptoms) in association with CAC. Methods: Participants (N D 3,189: 54.5% female; 51.5% Black; average age D 50.1 years) were followed from 1985-1986 through 2010-2011 in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Smoking exposure was measured by cumulative cigarette pack-years (cigarette packs smoked per day number of years smoking; year 0 through year 25). Depressive symptoms were measured using a 14-item, 3-factor (negative affect, anhedonia, somatic symptoms) model of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale (years 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25). CAC was assessed at year 25. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between the smoking by depressive symptom clusters interactions with CAC (D 0 vs. > 0), adjusted for CVD-related sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical covariates. Results: 907 participants (28% of the sample) had CAC > 0 at year 25. The depressive symptom clusters did not differ significantly between the two groups. Only the cumulative somatic symptom cluster by cumulative smoking exposure interaction was significantly associated with CAC > 0 at year 25 (p D.028). Specifically, adults with elevated somatic symptoms (score 9 out of 18) who had 10, 20, or 30 pack-years of smoking exposure had respective odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 2.06 [1.08, 3.93], 3.71 [1.81, 7.57], and 6.68 [2.87, 15.53], ps <.05.

The link between health lifestyles and CVD is well established, but most of the focus has been on SES and more research is needed on racial differences. Methods: Data were from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study of black (n=2,451) and white (n=2,351) men and women. Data were analyzed from baseline examinations in 1985-1986 when the participants were aged 18-30 years and any fatal or nonfatal CVD event that occurred over approximately the next 28 years (until August 2013). The first stage of the analysis used latent class models to identify distinct health lifestyles on the basis of race. The second stage used multinomial logit regression models to analyze specific characteristics in relation to the health lifestyles classes, followed by the third stage in which Cox proportional hazards models analyzed associations of the lifestyle classes with CVD risk. Results: Four separate health lifestyle patterns for blacks and four for whites were identified, with the ""unhealthy"" lifestyle among blacks (hazard ratio, 1.60) and ""most unhealthy"" lifestyle among whites (hazard ratio, 3.12) showing an elevated risk of CVD. An important difference is that, in every lifestyle class, blacks showed a higher probability of excessive energy intake than whites-indicative of the potential for obesity. Conclusions: Health lifestyles differ by race and support the exploratory hypothesis that distinct classes of healthy-unhealthy lifestyles exist within each racial group.

We tested whether baseline and time-varying depressive symptoms were associated with metabolic syndrome incidence in black and white men and women from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. Methods Participants reported depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at four examinations between 1995 and 2010. At those same examinations, metabolic syndrome was determined. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations of depressive symptoms on the development of metabolic syndrome in 3208 participants without metabolic syndrome at baseline. Results For 15 years, the incidence rate of metabolic syndrome (per 10,000 person-years) varied by race and sex, with the highest rate in black women (279.2), followed by white men (241.9), black men (204.4), and white women (125.3). Depressive symptoms (per standard deviation higher) were associated with incident metabolic syndrome in white men (hazard ratio = 1.25, 95% confidence interval = 1.08-1.45) and white women (hazard ratio = 1.17, 95% confidence interval = 1.00-1.37) after adjustment for demographic characteristics and health behaviors. There was no significant association between depression and metabolic syndrome among black men or black women.

Results: There were nonlinear trends in time-related weight gain in W, with larger weight gains early that attenuated at subsequent exams. Time-related trends were linear in M. There were nonlinear trends in aging-related weight gain in BM, BW, and WM, with the greatest weight gains at younger ages. Aging-related trends were linear in WW. Participants with overweight or obesity in early adulthood had greater attenuation of aging-related weight gain during middle adulthood.

The authors analyzed data from the year 20 examination of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, including medical history, physical examination, and dietary intake surveys for 3142 participants. Multivariable linear regression models controlled for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, and intakes of alcohol and total energy. Effect modification by race was tested. Overall, patients with hypertension had a lower daily intake of total dietary isoflavones (2.2 +/- 5.2 mg/d vs 4.1 +/- 11.7 mg/d; P<.001). In fully adjusted models, the highest quartile of dietary isoflavone intake was associated with a 4.4 mm Hg lower SBP on average compared with SBP for the lowest quartile. The relationship between dietary isoflavone intake and SBP was more pronounced among African Americans compared with Caucasians (P for interaction <.001). Greater dietary intake of isoflavones was independently associated with a lower SBP.

Methods: Data were from 1691 participants enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study aged 40 years or more in 2000-2001, who had follow-up examinations 5 and 10 years later. Results: The prevalence of obesity increased from 32.3% in 2000-2001 (mean age: 42.8 years) to 41.7% in 2010-2011, higher in blacks than whites. The corresponding change in 10-year ASCVD risk was significantly higher for blacks (men: 4.5%-9.6%, women: 1.7%-5.0%) than whites (men: 2.4%-5.2%, women: 0.7%-1.6%). In 2010-2011, 57.5% of black men had ASCVD risk scores of 7.5% or more compared to white men (14.7%), black women (17.4%), and white women (1.6%). Although BMI trends were positively associated with 10-year change in ASCVD risk scores (0.07% per 1 kg/m(2) increase), it explained very little variance in risk score trends in all race sex groups. Conclusions: In middle-aged adults, longitudinal changes in BMI had little independent influence on changes in 10 -year ASCVD risk scores as its effect may be largely mediated through ASCVD risk factors already accounted for in the risk score.

Methods: We included 1,625 women, aged 43 to 55 years, with measurements of hs-CRP and detailed reproductive histories in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study at follow-up year 25. Prevalent hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater, or use of antihypertensive medications.

We examined the longitudinal association between fish or LC omega 3PUFA intake and MetS incidence. Methods We prospectively followed 4356 American young adults, free from MetS and diabetes at baseline, for incident MetS and its components in relation to fish and LC omega 3PUFA intake. MetS was defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel III criteria.

Methods This was a multicenter longitudinal study of black and white men and women that began in 1985-1986, when participants were 18-30 years old. Adiponectin was measured at year 15 (2000-2001). Echocardiograms were completed at year 25 (2010-2011). Participants were stratified by the presence of hypertension. Risk factor-adjusted echocardiographic variables were compared across adiponectin quintiles. Linear and quadratic regression models were also derived for risk factor-adjusted echocardiographic variables. Results Relative to the lowest quintile of adiponectin, participants from the highest quintile had a 6% lower left ventricular mass index (LVMi) among normotensives and an 8% higher LVMi among hypertensives. Among normotensive participants, regression analysis showed a linear inverse relationship between adiponectin and LV mass, LVMi, posterior wall thickness, and ventricular septal thickness (all P=0.05). Among hypertensive participants, regression analysis showed a U-shaped relationship between adiponectin and LV mass, LVMi, posterior wall thickness, and ventricular septal thickness (P=0.005 for all quadratic terms). Conclusion Among normotensive participants, higher adiponectin may be a useful marker of less adverse future cardiac structure. Further study is required to determine whether adiponectin receptor agonists may provide a benefit among these individuals. Among hypertensive participants, further study is required to assess the prognostic and therapeutic use of adiponectin. Cardiovasc Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We hypothesized that a history of GDM would identify women at higher risk of NAFLD in middle age. METHODS: Women from the multicenter Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort study who delivered >= 1 birth, were free of diabetes prior to pregnancy(ies), and underwent CT quantification of hepatic steatosis 25 years following cohort entry (Y25: 2010-2011) were included (n = 1,115).

We tested whether PAT was associated with prevalent diabetes at the year 25 exam of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Methods and results: The CARDIA Year 25 exam (2010-2011) included complete data for all covariates on 3107 participants. Prevalent diabetes (n = 436) was defined as high fasting (>= 126 mg/dl) or 2-h postload glucose (>= 200 mg/dl) or HbA(1c) (>= 6.5%) or use of diabetes medications. Volume of PAT was measured from computed tomographic scans. Logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between quartiles of PAT and diabetes. In regression models adjusted for field center, sex, race, age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, log triglycerides, and treatment with blood pressure and cholesterol lowering medication, PAT volume in the 4th quartile was significantly associated with diabetes status after adjustment for BMI (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.66, 3.98) or visceral adipose tissue (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.32, 3.29).

However, the link between reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) remains poorly explored among young and middle-aged adults with preserved kidney function. In this study, we examined the association of cystatin C-based estimated GFR (eGFR(cys)) and rapid decline in eGFR with subsequent LVMI. Study Design: Observational study. Setting & Participants: We included 2,410 participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort with eGFR(cys) > 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at year 15 and who had an echocardiogram obtained at year 25. Predictor: eGFR(cys) at year 15 and rapid decline in eGFR(cys) (defined as >3% per year over 5 years from years 15 to 20). Outcome: LVMI measured at year 25. Measurements: We adjusted for age, sex, race, diabetes, body mass index, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, cumulative systolic blood pressure, and albuminuria. Results: Mean age was 40 +/- 4 (SD) years, 58% were women, and 43% were black. After 10 years of follow-up, mean LVMI was 39.6 +/- 13.4 g/m(2.7). Compared with eGFR(cys) > 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (n = 2,228), eGFR(cys) of 60 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (n = 29) was associated with 5.63 (95% Cl, 0.90-10.36) g/m(2.7) greater LVMI (P = 0.02), but there was no association of eGFR(cys) of 76 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (n = 153) with LVMI after adjustment for confounders. Rapid decline in eGFR(cys) was associated with higher LVMI compared with participants without a rapid eGFR(cys) decline (beta coefficient, 1.48; 95% Cl, 0.11-2.83; P = 0.03) after adjustment for confounders. Limitations: There were a limited number of participants with eGFR(cys) of 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Conclusions: Among young and middle-aged adults with preserved kidney function, eGFR(cys) of 60 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and rapid decline in eGFR(cys) were significantly associated with subsequently higher LVMI. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms that contribute to elevated LVMI in this range of eGFR(cys).

The prevalence of CAC was 28% and AAC was 53%. For each 1 point higher PDAY score, the odds of CAC were higher using baseline scores than year 25 scores (OR, 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-1.33 versus OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.11-1.14). For AAC, ORs at years 0 and 25 were similar (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.24-1.34 versus OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.19-1.26). C-statistic for CAC prediction was higher at year 0 than year 25 (0.731 versus 0.705) but similar at years 0 and 25 for AAC (0.665 versus 0.670). ORs for CAC were highest at baseline, and, for AAC, ORs were highest at year 10. Including change in PDAY scores with baseline scores improved prediction. Conclusions Atherosclerosis risk and change in risk assessed in young adulthood years before subclinical atherosclerosis imaging provide strong prediction of future subclinical atherosclerosis.

Methods: Participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, which recruited black and white participants aged 18 to 30 years at baseline, were included; echocardiography was performed at year 25. CVH at year 0 was defined on the basis of blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, body mass index, smoking status, diet, and physical activity. Two, 1, or 0 points were assigned to each component for ideal, intermediate, and poor levels of each component. Participants were stratified into CVH groups on the basis of point score: <= 8 (poor), 9 to 11 (intermediate), and 12 to 14 (ideal). Results: The distribution of CVH at year 0 was as follows: poor, n = 264 (9%); intermediate, n = 1,315 (47%); and ideal, n = 1,224 (44%). Individuals with ideal and intermediate CVH at year 0 had significantly lower LV end-diastolic volume and lower LV mass index at year 25. In participants with ideal and intermediate CVH, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for diastolic dysfunction at year 25 was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.37-0.73) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.46-0.83), respectively, compared with participants with poor CVH. Participants with ideal and intermediate CVH had significantly lower odds for LV hypertrophy; the LV mass index was 5.3 to 8.7 g/m(2.7) lower (P <.001 for both) than in participants with poor CVH. Conclusion: Greater levels of CVH in young adulthood are associated with lower LV mass and lower risk for diastolic dysfunction 25 years later.

Methods and Results We studied participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a cohort of young, healthy black and white individuals at baseline (1985-1986). Intake of F/V at baseline was assessed using a semiquantitative interview administered diet history, and coronary artery calcium was measured at year 20 (2005-2006) using computed tomography. We used logistic regression to adjust for relevant variables and estimate the adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals across energy-adjusted, sex-specific tertiles of total servings of F/V per day. Among our sample (n=2506), the mean (SD) age at baseline was 25.3 (3.5) years, and 62.7% were female. After adjustment for demographics and lifestyle variables, higher intake of F/V was associated with a lower prevalence of coronary artery calcium: odds ratio (95% confidence interval) =1.00 (reference), 0.78 (0.59-1.02), and 0.74 (0.56-0.99), from the lowest to the highest tertile of F/V, P value for trend <0.001. There was attenuation of the association between F/V and coronary artery calcium after adjustment for other dietary variables, but the trend remained significant: odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.00 (reference), 0.84 (0.63-1.11), and 0.92 (0.67-1.26), P value for trend <0.002].

The CARDIA Study,MEDICINE AND SCIENCE IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE,Article,"Background: For optimal health benefits, moderate- to vigorous- intensity physical activity ( MVPA) is recommended in sustained bouts lasting >= 10 min. However, short spurts of MVPA lasting <10 min are more common in everyday life. It is unclear whether short spurts of MVPA further protect against the development of hypertension and obesity in middle-age adults beyond bouted MVPA. Methods: Objectively measured physical activity was collected in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study at the 20- yr ( 2005- 2006) examination, and blood pressure and BMI were collected at the 20- and 25- yr ( 2010- 2011) examinations. Time spent in MVPA was classified as either bouted MVPA, i. e., >= 10 continuous minutes or short spurts of MVPA, i. e., <10 continuous minutes. To examine the association of short spurts of MVPA with incident hypertension and obesity over 5 yr, we calculated risk ratios adjusted for bouted MVPA and potential confounders. Results: Among 1531 and 1251 participants without hypertension and obesity, respectively, at year 20 ( age, 45.2 +/- 3.6 yr; 57.3% women; body mass index, 29.0 +/- 7.0 kgm-2), 14.8% and 12.1% developed hypertension and obesity by year 25. Study participants in the highest tertile of short spurts of MVPA were 31% less likely to develop hypertension 5 yr later ( risk ratio = 0.69 ( 0.490.96)) compared with those in the lowest tertile. There was no statistically significant association of short spurts of MVPA with incident obesity. Conclusions: These findings support the notion that accumulating short spurts of MVPA protects against the development of hypertension but not obesity in middle-age adults.",15,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0195-9131,1530-0315,MED SCI SPORT EXER,Med.

This study examined the associations of (1) baseline fitness with 25-year dyslipidemia incidence and (2) 20-year fitness change on dyslipidemia development in middle age in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA). Methods: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to test the association of baseline fitness (1985-1986) with dyslipidemia incidence over 25 years (20102011) in CARDIA (N=4,898). Modified Poisson regression models were used to examine the association of 20-year change in fitness with dyslipidemia incidence between Years 20 and 25 (n=2,487). Data were analyzed in June 2014 and February 2015. Results: In adjusted models, the risk of incident low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); high triglycerides; and high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was significantly lower, by 9%, 16%, and 14%, respectively, for each 2.0-minute increase in baseline treadmill endurance. After additional adjustment for baseline trait level, the associations remained significant for incident high triglycerides and high LDL-C in the total population and for incident high triglycerides in both men and women. In race-stratified models, these associations appeared to be limited to whites. In adjusted models, change in fitness did not predict 5-year incidence of dyslipidemias, whereas baseline fitness significantly predicted 5-year incidence of high triglycerides. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the importance of cardiorespiratory fitness in young adulthood as a risk factor for developing dyslipidemias, particularly high triglycerides, during the transition to middle age.

Methods: We used data from participants (n=5114) in the United States-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study and a structural equation model to estimate longitudinal (1985-86 to 2005-06) pathways simultaneously from neighborhood fast food restaurants, sit-down restaurants, supermarkets, and convenience stores to BMI through dietary behaviors, controlling for socioeconomic status (SES) and physical activity. Results: Higher numbers of neighborhood fast food restaurants and lower numbers of sit-down restaurants were associated with higher consumption of an obesogenic fast food-type diet. The pathways from food stores to BMI through diet were inconsistent in magnitude and statistical significance. Conclusions: Efforts to decrease the numbers of neighborhood fast food restaurants and to increase the numbers of sit-down restaurant options could influence diet behaviors.

Whether NAFLD is independently associated with subclinical myocardial remodeling or dysfunction among the general population is unknown. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 2,713 participants from the multicenter, community-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who underwent concurrent computed tomography (CT) quantification of liver fat and comprehensive echocardiography with myocardial strain measured by speckle tracking during the Year-25 examination (age, 43-55 years; 58.8% female and 48.0% black). NAFLD was defined as liver attenuation 40 Hounsfield units after excluding other causes of liver fat. Subclinical left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction was defined using values of absolute peak global longitudinal strain (GLS). Diastolic dysfunction was defined using Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging markers. Prevalence of NAFLD was 10.0%. Participants with NAFLD had lower early diastolic relaxation (e') velocity (10.8 +/- 2.6 vs. 11.9 +/- 2.8 cm/s), higher LV filling pressure (E/e' ratio: 7.7 +/- 2.6 vs. 7.0 +/- 2.3), and worse absolute GLS (14.2 +/- 2.4% vs. 15.2 +/- 2.4%) than non-NAFLD (P<0.0001 for all). When adjusted for HF risk factors or body mass index, NAFLD remained associated with subclinical myocardial remodeling and dysfunction (P<0.01).

Study design Analyses included 2583 women (African American = 1333; White = 1250) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort study over 25 years of follow-up (1985-2011). Outcomes included type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, adiposity, glucose, insulin, blood pressure, and blood lipids. Cox models or repeated measures linear regression models estimated the association between age at menarche and the outcomes. Results Each 1-year earlier age at menarche was associated with higher mean body mass index among African American (0.88 +/- 0.12 kg/m(2), P < .0001) and White (0.89 +/- 0.10 kg/m(2), P < .0001) women. After body mass index adjustment, each 1-year earlier age at menarche was associated with higher triglycerides (2.26 +/- 0.68 mg/dL, P = .001) and glucose (0.34 +/- 0.11 mg/dL, P = .002), and greater risk for incident impaired fasting glucose (hazard ratio = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.20) and metabolic syndrome (hazard ratio 1.19, 95% CI 1.11-1.26) among White women only. Conclusions Excess adiposity associated with earlier menarche is sustained through mid-adulthood, and primarily drives higher cardiometabolic risk factor levels. However, White women with earlier menarche had increased risk of a number of insulin-resistance related conditions independent of adiposity. The cardiometabolic impact of earlier menarche was weaker in African American women despite higher average adiposity.

We examined the association between IMT and cognitive function in a middle-aged epidemiological cohort of 2618 stroke-free participants. Methods-At the year 20 visit (our study baseline), participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study had IMT measured by ultrasound at the common carotid artery. Five years later, participants completed a cognitive battery consisting of the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test of verbal memory, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test of processing speed, and the Stroop test of executive function. We transformed cognitive scores into standardized z scores, with negative values indicating worse performance. Results-Mean age at baseline was 45.3 years (SD, 3.6). Greater IMT (per 1 SD difference of 0.12 mm) was significantly associated with worse performance on all cognitive tests (z scores) in unadjusted linear regression models (verbal memory, -0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.20 to -0.13; processing speed, -0.23; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.19; and executive function, -0.17; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.13).

METHODS: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study is a multicenter prospective cohort that enrolled 2,787 women in 1985-1986 (ages 18-30 years, 52% black, 48% white), of whom 2,014 (72%) attended the 20-year follow-up examination in 2005-2006. We selected 846 women (46% black) without heart disease or diabetes at baseline who delivered one or more times after the baseline evaluation, had cardiometabolic risk factors measured at baseline, and had maximum common carotid intima-media thickness (mm) measured at the 20-year follow-up examination in 2005-2006. Lactation duration was summed across all postbaseline births for each woman and (n, women) categorized as: 0 to less than 1 month (n=262), 1 to less than 6 months (n=210), 6 to less than 10 months (n=169), and 10 months or greater (n=205). Multiple linear regression models estimated mean common carotid intima-media thickness (95% confidence interval) and mean differences among lactation duration groups compared with the 0 to less than 1-month group adjusted for prepregnancy obesity, cardiometabolic status, parity, and other risk factors. RESULTS: Lactation duration had a graded inverse association with common carotid intima-media thickness; mean differences between 10 months or greater compared with 0 to less than 1 month ranged from -0.062 mm for unadjusted models (P trend <.001) to -0.029 mm for models fully adjusted for prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and cardiometabolic risk factors, parity, smoking, and sociodemographics (P trend=.010). Stepwise addition of potential mediators (BMI, systolic blood pressure at the 20-year follow-up examination) modestly attenuated the lactation and common carotid intima-media thickness association to -0.027 and -0.023 mm (P trend=.019 and .054).

We examined vascular risk factors with respect to a cerebrovascular measure of brain functioning in subjects in mid-life, which could represent a marker of brain changes in later life. Breathhold functional MRI (fMRI) was performed in 541 women and men (mean age 50.4 years) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Brain MRI sub-study. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) was quantified as percentage change in blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in activated voxels, which was mapped to a common brain template and log-transformed. Mean CVR was calculated for anatomic regions underlying the default-mode network (DMN) - a network implicated in AD and other brain disorders -in addition to areas considered to be relatively spared in the disease (e.g. occipital lobe), which were utilized as reference regions. Mean CVR was significantly reduced in the posterior cingulate/precuneus (beta = -0.063, 95% CI: -0.106, -0.020), anterior cingulate (beta = -0.055, 95% CI: -0.101, -0.010), and medial frontal lobe (beta = -0.050, 95% CI: -0.092, -0.008) relative to mean CVR in the occipital lobe, after adjustment for age, sex, race, education, and smoking status, in subjects with pre-hypertension/hypertension compared to normotensive subjects. By contrast, mean CVR was lower, but not significantly, in the inferior parietal lobe (beta = -0.024, 95% CI: -0.062, 0.014) and the hippocampus (beta = -0.006, 95% CI: -0.062, 0.050) relative to mean CVR in the occipital lobe. Similar results were observed in subjects with diabetes and dyslipidemia compared to those without these conditions, though the differences were non-significant. Reduced CVR may represent diminished vascular functionality for the DMN for individuals with prehypertension/hypertension in midlife, and may serve as a preclinical marker for brain dysfunction in later life.

Systemic inflammation is suspected as a potential mechanism of these associations. However, the complex relationships between sleep disturbance, social isolation, and inflammation have not been examined in a population-based longitudinal study. This study examined the longitudinal association between sleep disturbance and systemic inflammation, and the moderating effects of social isolation on this association. The CARDIA study is a population-based longitudinal study conducted in four US cities. Sleep disturbance - i.e., insomnia complaints and short sleep duration - was assessed in 2962 African-American and White adults at baseline (2000-2001, ages 33-45 years). Circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured at baseline and follow-up (2005-2006). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and subjective and objective social isolation (i.e., feelings of social isolation and social network size) were measured at follow-up. Sleep disturbance was a significant predictor of inflammation five years later after full adjustment for covariates (adjusted betas: 0.048, P = 0.012 for CRP; 0.047, P = 0.017 for IL-6). Further adjustment for baseline CRP revealed that sleep disturbance also impacted the longitudinal change in CRP levels over five years (adjusted beta: 0.044, P = 0.013). Subjective social isolation was a significant moderator of this association between sleep disturbance and CRP (adjusted beta 0.131, P = 0.002). Sleep disturbance was associated with heightened systemic inflammation in a general population over a five-year follow-up, and this association was significantly stronger in those who reported feelings of social isolation. Clinical interventions targeting sleep disturbances may be a potential avenue for reducing inflammation, particularly in individuals who feel socially isolated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study without diabetes at year 0 (Y0) (n = 2048, 43.4% men; mean age, 25 yr) had fitness quantified by treadmill at Y0 and Y20. Y0 BMI was normal (nBMI <25 kg.m(-2)) or high (hBMI >= 25 kg.m(-2)). Y0 IR status was insulin sensitive (IS) (homeostatic model assessment IR <1.84 (75th percentile)) or insulin resistant (IR) (homeostaticmodel assessment IR >= 1.84). Four groups were established: nBMI/IS, hBMI/IS, nBMI/IR, and hBMI/IR. Y0 fitness was low (<33rd percentile for sex) or average high (>= 33rd percentile for sex).

We aimed to characterize the association between background exposures to POPs with repeated measures of glucose homeostasis over 23-years. Methods: Within the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (year 0 ages: 18-30 years), we measured POPs in serum obtained in 1987-88 (follow-up year 2) in 90 non-diabetic controls and 90 cases diabetes-free at year 2 who became diabetic by year 20. We analyzed 32 POPs detectable in >= 75% of participants and created summary scores for 32 POPs, 23 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), and 8 organochlorine pesticides (OCP). Dependent variables were measures of glucose homeostasis at years 0-25 (up to 8 examinations). We explored associations using repeated measures regression adjusted for race, sex, concurrent body mass index (BMI), examination center and period, separately for cases and controls. Results: The associations between the three summary scores and measures of glucose homeostasis were present for observations at ages 40-55 years, and particularly between 48-55 years: the 23 PCB summary was associated with HbA1c (never-diabetics: slope [value per unit of summary score], beta=0.008, p=0.02; diabetics: beta=0.03, p=0.07), fasting glucose (never-diabetics: beta=0.24, p=0.003; diabetics: beta=1.10, p=0.03), and insulin sensitivity% (never-diabetics: beta=-2.82, p<0.001, diabetics: beta=-0.31, p=0.30). No associations were observed at younger ages. Conclusions: Glucose homeostasis may worsen after decades of exposure to PCBs and OCPs at background environmental levels, independent of BMI and after participants reached the 5th decade of life.

Methods: We studied 2435 participants in the community-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ( CARDIA) study of black and white men and women aged 18-30 in 1985-86 ( year 0, Y0). We hypothesized that a higher A Priori Diet Quality Score, measured at Y0 and Y20, is associated with better cognitive function measured at Y25. The diet score incorporated 46 food groups ( each in servings/day) as the sum of quintile ranks of food groups rated beneficial, 0 for food groups rated neutral, and reversed quintile ranks for food groups rated adverse; higher score indicated better diet quality. Y25 cognitive testing included verbal memory (Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test ( RAVLT)), psychomotor speed ( Digit Symbol Substitution Test ( DSST)) and executive function ( Stroop). Results: Per 10-unit higher diet score at Y20, the RAVLT was 0.32 words recalled higher, the DSST was 1.76 digits higher, and the Stroop was 1.00 seconds+errors lower ( better performance) after adjusting for race, sex, age, clinic, and energy intake.

Responses to self-administered questionnaires completed at 15- and 20-year follow-up exams were used to evaluate agreement in reporting asthma history and age at diagnosis and assess variation in agreement across categories of demographic and health-related characteristics. Results: A history of asthma was reported by 12% of participants at the 15-year exam and 11% of participants at the 20-year exam, with 97% agreement and an overall Kappa coefficient of 0.845 (95% confidence interval: 0.815-0.874). Kappa coefficients were higher among women than men and increased monotonically across categories of educational attainment. One-hundred eight participants (35%) reported exactly the same age at diagnosis at the two time points; for another 120 (39%), the difference in reported ages was <= 2 years. Age at asthma diagnosis reported at the 20-year exam was, on an average, 1 year (SD: 5.2) older than that reported at the 15-year exam. Conclusions: Five-year reliability in self-reported asthma history is high, and variation in reporting age at diagnosis is low across categories of participant characteristics. Nevertheless, agreement in responses at two times does not guarantee that self-administered questionnaires are sensitive tools for detecting a true asthma history.",16,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,NEW YORK,"52 VANDERBILT AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0277-0903,1532-4303,J ASTHMA,J.

Methods: From 2003 to 2005, an ancillary sleep study was conducted at the Chicago site of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Community-based black and white adults (aged 32-51 years) wore a wrist actigraph for up to six nights to record sleep duration and fragmentation. Sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Participants without history of cardiovascular or chronic kidney diseases, proteinuria, or hypertension at the 2000-2001 CARDIA examination were followed over 10 years (n = 463). eGFR was estimated from serum creatinine (eGFR(Cr)) at the 2000-2001, 2005-2006, and 2010-2011 CARDIA examinations, whereas cystatin-C-estimated eGFR (eGFR(Cys)) was measured at the 2000-2001 and 2005-2006 examinations. Generalized estimating equation regression and linear models estimated the associations of each sleep parameter with changes in eGFR(Cr) and eGFR(Cys), controlling for cardiovascular and renal risk. Results: Sleep parameters were not related to 5-year change in eGFR(Cys). However, each 1 h decrease in sleep duration was significantly associated with a 1.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2) higher eGFR(Cr) [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.2-2.7], and each one-point increase in PSQI was significantly associated with a 0.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 higher eGFR(Cr) (95% CI, 0.04-0.9) over 10 years.

Methods: After the year 25 examination (2010 - 2011), 203 CARDIA black and white men and women (age 50.3 +/- 3.6 yr) at the Oakland, CA, site participated in this comparison study. The between - questionnaire association and agreement were determined for continuous and categorical estimates on the basis of 1) quartiles and 2) meeting 2008 physical activity guidelines. Differences in participant characteristics by concordance/discordance status were also examined. Finally, receiver operating characteristic curves were computed to determine the accuracy of the PAH compared with the supplemental questionnaire. Results: Reported physical activity levels were high and varied significantly by race and sex (all P G 0.01). Between - questionnaire estimates were significantly correlated (rho = 0.75 to 0.90, all P < 0.001) and had high agreement (kappa = 0.51 to 0.80) across all race/sex groups. A higher proportion of women than men were classified as concordant by quartile of vigorous intensity (P - 0.001), but no other participant characteristics were associated with concordant/discordant quartile ranking. Participants classified as concordant on the basis of physical activity guidelines had lower body mass index than those classified as discordant (both P < 0.05). The area under the curve was 0.95, suggesting that the PAH has high accuracy for classifying individuals as meeting physical activity guidelines.

Yet, whether or not NAFLD is independently related to atherosclerosis is unclear. In a population-based cross-sectional sample of middle-aged adults free from liver or heart disease, we tested the hypothesis that NAFLD is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery (CAC) and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC)) independent of obesity. Methods: Participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study with CT quantification of liver fat, CAC and AAC were included (n = 2424). NAFLD was defined as liver attenuation <= 40 Hounsfield Units after exclusion of other causes of liver fat. CAC and AAC presence was defined as Agatston score > 0. Results: Mean participant age was 50.1 +/- 3.6 years, (42.7% men, 50.0% black) and BMI was 30.6 +/- 7.2 kg/ m(2). The prevalence of NAFLD, CAC, and AAC was 9.6%, 27.1%, and 51.4%. NAFLD participants had increased prevalence of CAC (37.9% vs. 26.0%, p < 0.001) and AAC (65.1% vs. 49.9%, p < 0.001). NAFLD remained associated with CAC (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.001e1.82) and AAC (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.29-2.35) after adjustment for demographics and health behaviors. However, these associations were attenuated after additional adjustment for visceral adipose tissue (CAC OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.74 - 1.48, AAC OR - 1.20; 95% CI, 0.86-1.67). There was no interaction by race or sex. Conclusion: In contrast to prior research, these findings suggest that obesity attenuates the relationship between NAFLD and subclinical atherosclerosis.

Design, Setting and Participants A total of 5115 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA) study, a population-based study of African American and European American people recruited at age 18-30 years in 1985/6 and followed over 25 years. Measurements Physical activity was self-reported during clinical examinations at baseline (1985/6) and at years 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 and 25 (2010/11); smoking status was reported each year (at examinations or by telephone, and imputed where missing). We used mixed linear models to estimate trajectories of physical activity under varying smoking conditions, with adjustment for participant characteristics and secular trends. Findings We found significant interactions by race/sex (P=0.02 for the interaction with cumulative years of smoking), hence we investigated the subgroups separately. Increasing years of smoking were associated with a decline in physical activity in black and white women and black men [e.g. coefficient for 10 years of smoking: -0.14; 95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.20 to -0.07, P<0.001 for white women].

We studied prospective associations of three dietary patterns with CAMs. Methods and results: In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, diet was assessed at years 0 (1985-86) and 7 (1992-93) examinations. Four circulating CAMs (E-selectin, P-selectin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), and vascular cellular adhesion molecule (VCAM)) were assayed at years 7 and 15 (2000-01). We created one index score ""A Priori Diet Quality Score"" and derived dietary patterns using principal components analysis (PCA). Multivariable linear regression models predicted year 15 CAMs from averaged (year 0/7) dietary patterns. The A Priori Diet Quality Score rated 46 food groups beneficial, neutral or adverse based on hypothesized health effects. We derived two PCA dietary patterns: ""fruit and vegetables (FV)"" (high intakes of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains) and ""meat"" (high intakes of red meat, refined grain, and butter). All dietary patterns were related to E-selectin and sICAM-1. P-selectin was not related to the FV dietary pattern. VCAM was only related to the A Priori Diet Quality Score. Strongest associations were for the meat dietary pattern with E-selectin (effect size 28% of an SD (+3.9/13.7 ng/mL)) and P-selectin (effect size 37% of an SD (+4.1/11.2 ng/mL)) and the A Priori Diet Quality Score with sICAM-1 (effect size 34% of an SD (-15.1/44.7 ng/mL)) and VCAM (effect size of 26% of an SD (-45.1/170.3 ng/mL)).

Design Prospective community-based cohort study. Methods CARDIA participants who attended the year-20 exam (n = 2283, mean age 45 years) were grouped by pCVD status: maternal only, paternal only, any parental, and no parental history (referent). We used separate logistic regression models, adjusted for average risk factor levels over a 20-year follow up to assess associations of parental pCVD and subclinical atherosclerosis in offspring. Results White participants with any parental history of pCVD had a higher odds of coronary artery calcium (CAC) >0 than participants with no parental history (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.37). This was largely driven by the association of a paternal history of pCVD with CAC >0 (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.42-3.23), which was minimally attenuated by multivariable adjustment (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.31-3.32). Similarly, adjusted associations between parental pCVD and intima-media thickness (IMT) >90% were observed in white participants with a paternal history of pCVD (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.10-3.39) and any parental history pCVD (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.02-2.74).

We sought to examine the association of body mass index (BMI) with kidney function decline in a cohort of young adults with preserved glomerular filtration at baseline. Study Design: Longitudinal cohort. Setting & Participants: 2,839 black and white young adults with cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR(cys)). > 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) taking part in the year-10 examination (in 1995-1996) of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. Predictor: BMI, categorized as 18.5-24.9 (reference), 25.0-29.9, 30.0-39.9, and 40.0 kg/m(2). Outcomes: Trajectory of kidney function decline, rapid decline (>3% per year), and incident eGFR(cys) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) over 10 years of follow-up. Measurements: GFR(cys) estimated from the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation for calibrated cystatin C at CARDIA years 10, 15, and 20. Results: At year 10, participants had a mean age of 35.1 years, median eGFRcys of 114 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and 24.5% had BMI 30.0 kg/m(2). After age 30 years, average eGFR(cys) was progressively lower with each increment in BMI after adjustment for baseline age, race, sex, hyperlipidemia, smoking status, and physical activity. Higher BMI category was associated with successively higher odds of rapid decline (for 25.0-29.9, 30.0-39.9, and $ 40.0 kg/m(2), adjusted ORs were 1.50 [95% CI, 1.21-1.87], 2.01 [95% CI, 1.57-2.87], and 2.57 [95% CI, 1.67-3.94], respectively). 18 participants (0.6%) had incident eGFR(cys) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). In unadjusted analysis, higher BMI category was associated with incident eGFR(cys) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m (2) (for 25.0-29.9, 30.0-39.9, and 40.0 kg/m(2), ORs were 5.17 [95% CI, 1.10-25.38], 7.44 [95% CI, 1.54-35.95], and 5.55 [95% CI, 0.50-61.81], respectively); adjusted associations were no longer significant. Limitations: Inability to describe kidney function before differences by BMI category were already evident. Absence of data for measured GFR or GFR estimated from serum creatinine level. Conclusions: Higher BMI categories are associated with greater declines in kidney function in a cohort of young adults with preserved GFR at baseline. Clinicians should vigilantly monitor overweight and obese patients for evidence of early kidney function decline.

Left ventricular mass (LVM) relates to cardiovascular disease (CVD), with unclear value in youth. In a young biracial cohort, we investigate how FRS predicts CVD over 20 years and the incremental value of LVM. We also explore the predictive ability of different cut-points for hypertrophy. Methods: We assessed FRS and echocardiography-derived LVM(indexed by body surface area or height(2.7)) from 3980 African-American and white Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) participants (1990-1991); and followed over 20 years for a combined endpoint: cardiovascular death; nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease. Weassessed the predictive ability of FRS for CVD and also calibration, discrimination, and net reclassification improvement for adding LVM to FRS. Results: Mean age was 30 +/- 4 years, 46% males, and 52% white. Event incidence (n = 118) across FRS groups was, respectively, 1.3%, 5.4%, and 23.1% (p < 0.001); and was 1.4%, 1.3%, 3.7%, and 5.4% (p < 0.001) across quartiles of LVM(cut-points 117 g, 144 g, and 176 g). LVMpredicted CVD independently of FRS, with the best performance in normal weight participants. Adding LVM to FRS modestly increased discrimination and had a statistically significant reclassification. The 85th percentile (>= 116 g/m(2) formen; >= 96 g/m(2) for women) showed event prediction more robust than currently recommended cut-points for hypertrophy. Conclusion: In a biracial cohort of young adults, FRS and LVM are helpful independent predictors of CVD. LVM can modestly improve discrimination and reclassify participants beyond FRS. Currently recommended cut-points for hypertrophy may be too high for young adults. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Binary and polytomous logistic regression models were used to assess the relation of log(2)(selenium) and selenium quintiles with presence of depressive symptoms (CES-D score >= 27 or on antidepressant medication). Relative to selenium quintile 1, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for having depressive symptoms in 1990 for quintile 5 was 1.59(95% CI: 1.01, 2.51) and a unit increase in log2(selenium), which represents a doubling of the selenium level, was associated with an OR = 2.03 (95% CI: 1.12, 3.70). When examining 1,2 or 3+ exams vs. no exams with symptoms, the OR for quintile 5 was 1.73 (1.04, 2.89) for 3+ exams and for one exam and two exams, there were no associations. In a generalized estimating equations longitudinal model, a doubling of the selenium level was associated with a 56% higher odds of having depressive symptoms at an exam. Contrary to previously reported findings related to mood, higher level of selenium exposure was associated with presence of elevated depressive symptoms. More research is needed to elucidate the role of selenium in depressive disorders. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Objectives were to evaluate associations of childhood family psychosocial environment with carotid intima media thickness (IMT), a subclinical measure of atherosclerosis. The study population included 2659 CARDIA study participants, aged 37-52 years. Childhood family psychosocial environment was measured using a risky family questionnaire via self-report. Carotid IMT was calculated using the average of 20 measurements of mean common carotid, bulb and internal carotid IMT, assessed using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound images. Utilizing linear regression analyses adjusted for age, a 1-unit (range 0-21) increase in risky family score was associated with 0.0036 (95% Cl: 0.0006,0.0066 mm) and 0.0020 (95% Cl: 0.0002,0.0038) mm increase in mean IMT in white males and females, respectively. Formal mediation analyses and covariate adjustments suggested childhood socioeconomic position and smoking may be important mechanisms in white males and females, as well as education and depressive symptomatology in white males. No associations were found in black participants. Formal statistical tests for interaction between risky family score and sex, and between risky family score and race/ethnicity, demonstrated borderline evidence of interactions for both sex (p = 0.12) and race/ethnicity (p = 0.14) with risky family score for associations with mean IMT. In conclusion, childhood family psychosocial environment was positively associated with IMT in white participants, with little evidence of association in black participants. Mechanisms in white participants may include potential negative impacts of socioeconomic constraints on parenting quality, potentially influencing offspring's cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. smoking), socioeconomic position (e.g. education), and/or psychosocial functioning (e.g. depression), which may in turn lead to atherosclerotic processes. Borderline racial/ethnic differences in findings should be replicated, but add to literature exploring race/ethnicity-specific associations of parenting approaches with health outcomes.

Purpose: This study aimed to determine whether sedentary screen time is associated with measures of left ventricular structure and function. Methods: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study measured screen time by questionnaire and left ventricular structure and function by echocardiography in 2854 black and white participants, age 43-55 yr, in 2010-2011. Generalized linear models evaluated cross-sectional trends for echocardiography measures across higher categories of screen time and adjusting for demographics, smoking, alcohol, and physical activity. Further models adjusted for potential intermediate factors (blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes, and body mass index). Results: The relationship between screen time and left ventricular mass (LVM) differed in blacks versus whites. Among whites, higher screen time was associated with larger LVM (P < 0.001), after adjustment for height, demographics, and lifestyle variables. Associations between screen time and LVM persisted when adjusting for blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, and diabetes (P = 0.008) but not with additional adjustment for body mass index (P = 0.503). Similar relationships were observed for screen time with LVM indexed to height(2.7), relative wall thickness, and mass-to-volume ratio. Screen time was not associated with left ventricular structure among blacks or left ventricular function in either race group. Conclusions: Sedentary screen time is associated with greater LVM in white adults, and this relationship was largely explained by higher overall adiposity. The lack of association in blacks supports a potential qualitative difference in the cardiovascular consequences of sedentary screen-based behavior.",11,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0195-9131,1530-0315,MED SCI SPORT EXER,Med.

The association of LV mass with the future LVEF in younger populations has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation of LV mass index (LVMI) at ages 23 to 35 years to LV function after 20 years of follow-up in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a longitudinal study that enrolled young adults in 1985 and 1986. In this study, participants with echocardiographic examinations at years 5 and 25 were included. LVMI and the LVEF were assessed Wing M-mode echocardiography at year 5 and using M-mode and 2-dimensional imaging at year 25. Statistical analytic models assessed the correlation between LVMI and LV functional parameters cross-sectionally and longitudinally. A total of 2,339 participants were included. The mean LVEF at year 25 was 62%. Although there was no cross-sectional correlation between LVMI and the LVEF at year 5, there was a small but statistically significant negative correlation between LVMI at year 5 and the LVEF 20 years later (r = -0.10, p <0.0001); this inverse association persisted for LVMI in the multivariate model. High LVMI was an independent predictor of systolic dysfunction (LVEF <50%) 20 years later (odds ratio 1.46, p = 0.0018). In conclusion, LVMI in young adulthood in association with chronic risk exposure affects systolic function in middle age; the antecedents of heart failure may occur at younger ages than previously thought.

Objective: To describe long-term prevalence of relapse and related smoking patterns by sex, race, age, and education level among a community-based cohort of young adults followed for 25 years. Methods: We examined 25 years of data from Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), an ongoing study of a community-based cohort of 5115 men and women aged 18 to 30 years at baseline with periodic re-examinations. At each examination smoking, quitting, and relapse were queried. We examined prevalence of smoking relapse among 3603 participants who attended at least 6 of the 8 examinations. Results: About 53% of 3603 participants never reported smoking on a regular basis. Among the remaining 1682 ever smokers, 52.8% of those who reported current smoking at baseline were still smoking by the end of the study, compared to 10.7% of those who initiated smoking by year 5. Among those classified as former smokers at baseline, 39% relapsed at least once; of these, 69.5% had quit again by the end of the study. Maximum education level attained, age at study baseline, and race were associated with failure to quit smoking by the end of the study and relapse among those who did quit Maximum education level attained and age at study baseline were also associated with ability to successfully quit after a relapse. Conclusions: Smoking relapse after quitting is common, especially in those with lower education level. Education was the strongest predictor of all three outcomes. Improvements in access to treatment and treatment options, especially for underserved populations, are needed to prevent relapse when smokers quit.

The combination of high negative affect and low positive affect may have a bigger impact on increasing HPA axis activity than either positive or negative affect alone. Financial strain may both dampen positive affect as well as increase negative affect, and thus provides an excellent context for understanding the associations between daily affect and cortisol. Using random effects mixed modeling with maximum likelihood estimation, we examined the relationship between self-reported financial strain and estimated mean daily cortisol level (latent cortisol variable), based on six salivary cortisol assessments throughout the day, and whether this relationship was mediated by greater daily negative to positive affect index measured concurrently in a sample of 776 Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study participants. The analysis revealed that while no total direct effect existed for financial strain on cortisol, there was a significant indirect effect of high negative affect to low positive affect, linking financial strain to elevated cortisol. In this sample, the effects of financial strain on cortisol through either positive affect or negative affect alone were not significant. A combined affect index may be a more sensitive and powerful measure than either negative or positive affect alone, tapping the burden of chronic financial strain, and its effects on biology.

Design and settingThe CARDIA study followed 5115 Black and White individuals aged 18-30years in 1985-1986 (year 0). Subclinical atherosclerosis comprised coronary artery calcified plaque (CAC; years 15, 20 and 25), and maximum common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT; year 20). sUA (years 0, 10, 15 and 20) was modelled as gender-specific quartiles that were pooled. Discrete-time hazard regressions and generalized linear regressions were used for analyses. ResultsMean sUA concentration was lower in women than in men and increased with age. Adjusting for demographic and lifestyle factors, the highest versus lowest quartile of sUA at year 0 was associated with a 44% [95% confidence interval (CI) 20%, 73%] greater risk of CAC progression from years 15 to 25 (P-trend<0.001), which was attenuated by adjustment for BMI at year 0 (P-trend=0.45).

Methods and results:We studied participants from the Year 20 examination of the middle-aged, biracial CARDIA cohort. This examination included measurement of traditional risk factors, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurement and common carotid intima-media thickness (CC-IMT). ECGs were coded using both Minnesota Code (MC) and Novacode (NC) criteria. Isolated minor STTA was defined by MC as presence of MC 4-3, 4-4, 5-3, or 5-4, and by NC as presence of NC 5.8.

Less is known about the burden of calcified subclinical atherosclerosis and cognition, especially in midlife. We examined the association of coronary artery and abdominal aortic calcified plaque (CAC and AAC, respectively) with cognitive functioning in middle-aged adults. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 2510 black and white adults (age: 43-55 years) without heart disease or stroke who completed a year 25 follow-up exam (2010-11) as part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. CAC and AAC were measured with non-contrast computed tomography. Cognition was assessed with the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) (psychomotor speed), Stroop Test (executive function), and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) (verbal memory). Results: A greater amount of CAC and AAC was associated with worse performance on each test of cognitive function after adjustment for age, sex, race, education, and study center. Associations were attenuated, but remained significant for the DSST and RAVLT following additional adjustment for vascular risk factors, including adiposity, smoking, alcohol use, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. Compared to participants without CAC or AAC, those with both CAC and AAC, but not CAC or AAC alone was associated with lower DSST scores (p < 0.05). Conclusions: In this community-based sample, greater subclinical atherosclerotic calcification was associated with worse psychomotor speed and memory in midlife.

This study assessed weight gain in mothers and fathers (by birth or other); using longitudinal repeated-measures models to assess BMI changes over time; parents were compared with nonparents. Data were from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort study and included 2,881 black and white adults, ages 18 to 30 years, without children at baseline (1985-1986), and from four urban locations.

In total, 272 and 566 subjects had CAC scores > 0 at year (Y) 15 and Y20, respectively. Baseline total WBC counts were cross-sectionally associated with SBP, BMI, and smoking, or HDL-cholesterol (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.01) at Y0, and prospectively associated with C-reactive protein at Y7, Y15, and Y20, and fibrinogen at Y5 and Y20 (p < 0.01). After adjustment for potential confounding factors, baseline neutrophil count was borderline associated with CAC presence 15 years later (OR = 1.18 per unit, 95 % CI 1.00-1.44) and total WBC (OR = 1.07, 95 % CI 0.96-1.19) or eosinophil (OR = 1.12, 95 %CI 1.00-1.25) was borderline associated with CAC presence at Y20. Baseline total WBC counts in young adults was associated prospectively with CAC presence 20 years later after adjusting for age, sex, and race. Results are attenuated when other risk factors are accounted for.

Tools that predict this milestone have relevance for clinical and research purposes. Among infertile women, a positive relationship exists between antral follicle count (AFC) and response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, a marker of ovarian reserve. However, an age-independent relationship between AFC and menopause has not been demonstrated. Thus, our objective was to evaluate the relationship between AFC measured in women aged 34 to 49 years and incident natural menopause during 7 years of follow-up. Methods: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study is a longitudinal community-based study (Chicago, IL; Birmingham, AL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland, CA) begun in 1985-1986. In 2002-2003, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Women's Study measured follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and performed a transvaginal ultrasound protocol that included AFC (2-10 mm follicles on both ovaries). Incident natural menopause was assessed by surveys in 2005-2006 and 2009-2010. Results: In our sample (n = 456), the median (interquartile range) AFC and FSH level were 5 (2-9) and 7.8 (5.6-11.0) mIU/mL, respectively, at a mean (range) age of 42 (34-49) years in 2002-2003. One hundred one women reported natural menopause by 2009-2010. In Cox models, current smoking, stable menses, FSH level higher than 13 mIU/mL, and AFC of 4 or less were independently associated with incident natural menopause. Compared with AFC higher than 4, those with an AFC of 4 or less were nearly twice as likely to have undergone menopause during 7 years of follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.19-3.02) after adjustment for covariates. Conclusions: AFC has been found to be independently associated with natural menopause during 7 years of follow-up after controlling for other markers of ovarian aging.",19,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1072-3714,1530-0374,MENOPAUSE,Menopause-J.

Methods: Complete risk factor, coronary artery calcification (CAC), and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) data were available for 2435 participants. Lipids were categorized into quartiles, CAC at Y20 was dichotomized as present/absent, and CIMT was dichotomized as >= 84 or <84th overall percentile. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the association between lipids and CAC/CIMT. C statistics were used to assess the discriminative value of each lipid measure in predicting the presence of CAC or CIMT at Y20. Results: Lipid levels measured in young adulthood as well as middle age were both associated with subclinical disease in middle age. The discriminatory value of lipids was virtually identical at baseline, when participants were 18-30 years of age, and 20 years later. Neither baseline nor Y20 lipid data were strong predictors of Y20 subclinical disease despite statistically significant associations. Conclusions: These results are consistent with a growing body of evidence that early-life exposure to nonoptimal lipids matters and lifestyle modifications administered earlier in the lifespan could slow the progress of the atherosclerotic plaques.

Whether there are race differences in kidney function loss in younger healthy persons is not well established. Study Design: Longitudinal. Setting & Participants: 3,348 black and white adults with at least 2 measurements of cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR(cys)) at scheduled Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) examinations (years 10, 15, and 20). Predictor: Race. Outcomes & Measurements: We used linear mixed models to examine race differences in annualized rates of eGFR(cys) decline, adjusting for age, sex, lifetime exposure to systolic blood pressure >120 mm Hg, diabetes, and albumin-creatinine ratio. We used Poisson regression to compare racial differences in rapid decline (eGFR(cys) decline >3% per year) by study period (10-15 years after baseline examination [defining period 1] and >15-20 years after baseline examination [defining period 2]). Results: Mean age was 35 +/- 3.6 (SD) years, and mean eGFR(cys) was 110 +/- 20 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for blacks and 104 +/- 17 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for whites at baseline. For both blacks and whites, eGFR(cys) decline was minimal at younger ages (<35 years) and eGFR(cys) loss accelerated at older ages. However, acceleration of eGFR(cys) decline occurred at earlier ages for blacks than whites. Blacks had somewhat faster annualized rates of decline compared with whites, but differences were attenuated after adjustment in period 1 (0.13 mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year faster; P = 0.2). In contrast, during period 2, blacks had significantly faster annualized rates of decline, even after adjustment (0.32 mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year faster; P = 0.003). The prevalence of rapid decline was significantly higher for blacks versus whites, with prevalence rate ratios of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.04-1.63) for period 1 and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.09-1.41) for period 2. Differences were attenuated after full adjustment: adjusted prevalence rate ratios were 1.20 (95% CI, 0.95-1.49) for period 1 and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.96-1.26) for period 2. Limitations: No measured GFR. Conclusions: eGFR(cys) decline differs by race at early ages, with faster annualized rates of decline for blacks. Future studies are required to explain the observed differences.

Factors: Current smoking, physical activity, fast food habits, obesity, and diet quality, which was based on 8 fundamental components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, including increased intake of fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, and nuts and legumes and reduced intake of sodium, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats. Outcomes & Measurements: Spot urine albumin-creatinine ratios were obtained at baseline (1995-1996) and three 5-year follow-up examinations (5, 10, and 15 years' follow-up). Incident microalbuminuria was defined as the presence of age- and sex-adjusted albumin-creatinine ratio >= 25 mg/g at 2 or more of the successive follow-up examinations.

Using CARDIA data, we compared the validity of six approaches for classifying perimenopause status in order to better understand the performance of classification techniques which can be applied to general cohort data. Specifically, we examined the validity of a self-reported question concerning changes in menstrual cycle length and two full prediction models using all available data concerning menstrual cycles as potential indicators of perimenopause. The validity of these three novel methods of perimenopause classification were compared to three previously established classification methods. Methods: For each method, women were classified as pre- or pen-menopausal at Year 15 of follow-up (ages 32-46). Year 15 perimenopause status was then used to predict Year 20 post-menopausal status (yes/no) to estimate measures of validity and area under the curve. Results: The validity of the methods varied greatly, with four having an area under the curve greater than 0.8. Conclusions: When designing studies, researchers should collect the data required to construct a prediction model for classifying perimenopause status that includes age, smoking status, vasomotor symptoms, and cycle irregularities as predictors. The inclusion of additional data regarding menstrual cycles can be used to construct a full prediction model which may offer improved validity. Valid classification methods that use readily available data are needed to improve the scientific accuracy of research regarding perimenopause, promote research on this topic, and inform clinical practices.

Design We used data from the longitudinal Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study for 1169 African-Americans and 1322 whites. To assess racial discrimination, we used a four category variable to capture the extent and persistence of self-reported discrimination between examination at years 7 (1992-1993) and 15 (2000-2001). We assessed smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity at year 20 (2005-2006). Segregation was examined as the racial/ethnic composition at the Census tract level. Results Discrimination was more common in African-Americans (89.1%) than in whites (40.0%). Living in areas with high percentage of blacks was associated with less reports of discrimination in African-Americans but more reports in whites. After adjustment for selected characteristics including individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic conditions and segregation, we found significant positive associations of discrimination with smoking and alcohol consumption in African-Americans and with smoking in whites. African-Americans experiencing moderate or high discrimination were more physically active than those reporting no discrimination.

Comprehensive measures of food intake may be uniquely informative, given the complexity of oxidative systems and the possibility of antioxidant synergies. We quantified associations over a 20-year history between three food-based dietary patterns (summary measures of whole diet) and a plasma biomarker of lipid peroxidation, F-2-isoprostanes, in a cohort of Americans ages 18-30 at year 0 (1985-1986). We assessed diet at years 0, 7, and 20 through a detailed history of past-month food consumption and supplement use and measured plasma F-2-isoprostanes at years 15 and 20. We created three dietary patterns: (1) a priori (""a priori diet quality score"") based on hypothesized healthfulness of foods, (2) an empirical pattern reflecting high fruit and vegetable intake (""fruit-veg""), and (3) an empirical pattern reflecting high meat intake (""meat""). We used linear regression to estimate associations between each dietary pattern and plasma F-2-isoprostanes cross-sectionally (at year 20, n=2736) and prospectively (year 0/7 average diet and year 15/20 average F-2-isoprostanes, n=2718), adjusting for age, sex, race, total energy intake, education, smoking, body mass index, waist circumference, physical activity, and supplement use. In multivariable-adjusted cross-sectional analysis, the a priori diet quality score and the fruit-veg diet pattern were negatively, and the meat pattern was positively, associated with F-2-isoprostanes (all p values <0.001). These associations remained statistically significant in prospective analysis. Our findings suggest that long-term adherence to a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low in red meat may decrease lipid peroxidation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

MLR analyses showed that male gender and AA ethnicity were negatively associated with toenail Hg levels, and that age, living in Oakland city, education level, alcohol consumption, and total fish intake were positively associated with toenail Hg concentrations within each ethnicity-gender subgroup. Current smokers were found to have higher Hg only in AA men. This study suggested age, gender, ethnicity, study center, alcohol, education level, and fish consumption consistently predict toenail Hg levels.

This study tests the hypothesis that an increase in self-reported experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination predicts gains in waist circumference and body mass index in Black and White women and men over eight years. In race/ethnicity- and gender-stratified models, this study examined whether change in self-reported experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination predicts changes in waist circumference and body mass index over time using a fixed-effects regression approach in SAS statistical software, providing control for both measured and unmeasured time-invariant covariates. Between 1992-93 and 2000-01, self-reported experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination decreased among 843 Black women (75% to 73%), 601 Black men (80% to 77%), 893 White women (30% to 23%) and 856 White men (28% to 23%). In fixed-effects regression models, controlling for all time-invariant covariates, social desirability bias, and changes in education and parity (women only) over time, an increase in self-reported experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination over time was significantly associated with an increase in waist circumference (beta = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.00-2.19, p = 0.05) and an increase in body mass index (beta = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.19-1.16, p = 0.007) among Black women. No associations were observed among Black men and White women and men. These findings suggest that an increase in self-reported experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination may be associated with increases in waist circumference and body mass index among Black women over time.",32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0021-9320,1469-7599,J BIOSOC SCI,J.

Overall ideal cardiovascular health incorporates 7 metrics, including the avoidance of overweight or obesity, a healthful diet, nonsmoking, and physical activity, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting glucose at goal levels. Methods This analysis of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, a multicenter community-based study with 25 years of follow-up, included 2,932 participants aged 18 to 30 years at baseline (year 0) who attended follow-up examinations at years 7 and 25. Cardiovascular health metrics were measured at each examination. The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), modified Stroop test, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) were completed at year 25. Results A greater number of ideal cardiovascular metrics in young adulthood and middle age were independently associated with better cognitive function in midlife (p for trend < 0.01, for all). Specifically, each additional ideal metric was associated with 1.32 more symbols on the DSST (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.93 1.71), a 0.77-point lower interference score on the Stroop test (95% CI=1.03 to 0.45), and 0.12 more words on the RAVLT (95% CI = 0.04 to 0.20). Participants who had 5 ideal metrics at a greater number of the 3 examinations over the 25-year period exhibited better performance on each cognitive test in middle age (p for trend < 0.01, for all). Interpretation Ideal cardiovascular health in young adulthood and its maintenance to middle age is associated with better psychomotor speed, executive function, and verbal memory in midlife.

In a young cohort, we sought to determine longitudinal associations between changes in/development of TRFs and fibrinogen levels over 13 years. Methods: We included 2525 adults from the CARDIA study, aged 25-37 with fibrinogen and TRFs measured at year 7 (study baseline; 1992-1993); and year 20 (follow-up). Multiple linear regressions were used to compare mean changes in fibrinogen to TRFs. Results: Mean fibrinogen increased by 71 mg/dL vs. 70 mg/dL (p = NS) in black vs. white men, and 78 mg/dL vs. 68 mg/dL (p < 0.05) in black vs. white women, respectively over 13 years. After multivariable adjustments, fibrinogen generally rose with increasing BMI (p < 0.001; all sex/race groups), LDL cholesterol, log triglycerides and diastolic blood pressure; and fell with increasing HDL cholesterol and physical activity. 13-year increase in fibrinogen for persons who quit smoking or became non-obese were comparable (p = NS) to that of never-smokers and never-obese persons. Conclusions: Among young black and white men and women with few baseline cardiovascular risk factors, fibrinogen tracked longitudinally with changes in TRFs over 13 years through middle age. There was a strong inverse longitudinal relationship between modifiable risk factors (weight loss/smoking cessation) and 13-year change in fibrinogen. Our study helps provide some insight into the role of fibrinogen as a disease marker in the associations between fibrinogen and CVD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Inflammation may be one pathway through which SES influences health. Using 2658 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, we examine whether two measures of SES assessed at baseline (mean age, 32 +/- 4 years)-years of education and household income-predict change in C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations over the course of 13 years. We also examine whether four health-related behaviors-smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and alcohol consumption-mediate the prospective association of SES with CRP. Both higher education and household income predicted smaller increases in CRP over the 13 years of follow-up independent of age, sex, race, CARDIA center, body mass, medical diagnoses, medications, and hormone use (among women). Associations did not differ by race or sex. When examined in separate analyses, smoking and fruit and vegetable intake each accounted for a significant proportion of the respective effects of education and household income on CRP change, and physical activity a significant proportion of the effect of household income. These findings suggest that poor health behaviors among persons of lower socioeconomic status can have long-term effects on inflammation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: A total of 4077 adult participants reported father's and mother's educational attainments at study enrollment (Year 0) and own educational attainment at enrollment and at all follow-up examinations. Resting BP also was measured at all examinations. Data from examination Years 5 (when participant M [SD] age = 30 [3] years), 7, 10, 15, and 20 are examined here. Associations of own adult (Year 5), mother's, and father's educations with 15-year BP trajectories were examined in separate multilevel models. Fully controlled models included time-invariant covariates (age, sex, race, recruitment center) and time-varying covariates that were measured at each examination (marital status, body mass, cholesterol, oral contraceptives/hormones, and antihypertensive drugs). Analyses of parental education controlled for own education. Results: When examined without covariates, higher education - own (SBP gamma = -0.03, DBP gamma = -0.03), mother's (SBP gamma = -0.02, DBP gamma = -0.02), and father's (SBP gamma = -0.02, DBP gamma = -0.01)were associated with attenuated 15-year increases in BP (p < .001). Associations of own (but not either parent's) education with BP trajectories remained independent of standard controls.

Prior studies suggest there may be an association between self-reported experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination and inflammation, particularly C-reactive protein (CRP). It is not known whether that association is influenced by race/ethnicity and gender. In separate hierarchical linear models with time-varying covariates, we examined that association among 901 Black women, 614 Black men, 958 White women, and 863 White men in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study in four US communities. Self-reported experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination were ascertained in 1992-93 and 2000-01. Inflammation was measured as log-transformed CRP in those years and 2005-06. All analyses were adjusted for blood pressure, plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), age, education, and community. Our findings extend prior research by suggesting that, broadly speaking, self-reported experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination are associated with inflammation; however, this association is complex and varies for Black and White women and men. Black women reporting 1 or 2 experiences of discrimination had higher levels of CRP compared to Black women reporting no experiences of discrimination (beta = 0.141, SE = 0.062, P < 0.05). This association was not statistically significant among Black women reporting 3 or more experiences of discrimination and not independent of modifiable risks (smoking and obesity) in the final model. White women reporting 3 or more experiences of discrimination had significantly higher levels of CRP compared to White women reporting no experiences of discrimination independent of modifiable risks in the final model (beta = 0.300, SE = 0.113, P < 0.01).

Although cross-sectional studies suggest childhood adversity is associated with adulthood fatigue, longitudinal evidence of this relationship and its specific biological mechanisms have not been established. This longitudinal study examined the association between early life stress and adulthood fatigue and tested whether this association was mediated by low-grade systemic inflammation as indexed by circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a population-based longitudinal study conducted in 4 US cities, early life stress was retrospectively assessed in 2716 African-American and white adults using the Risky Families Questionnaire at Year 15 examination (2000-2001, ages 33-45 years). Fatigue as indexed by a loss of subjective vitality using the Vitality Subscale of the 12-item Short Form Health Survey was assessed at both Years 15 and 20. While CRP was measured at both Years 15 and 20, IL-6 was measured only at Year 20. Early life stress assessed at Year 15 was associated with adulthood fatigue at Year 20 after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, body-mass index, medication use, medical comorbidity, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, current stress, pain, sleep disturbance as well as Year 15 fatigue (adjusted beta 0.047, P = 0.007). However, neither CRP nor IL-6 was a significant mediator of this association. In summary, early life stress assessed in adulthood was associated with fatigue 5 years later, but this association was not mediated by low-grade systemic inflammation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Few studies exist on other dietary factors or using longitudinal data. Objective To compare change in daily dietary intake of selected foods and nutrients across 7 years between adults who have children enter the home and those who do not. Design Analysis of data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort study. Dietary intake was assessed by the diet history questionnaire used in that study. The main dependent variables were change from baseline (1985-1986) to Year 7 (1992-1993) for intake of percent saturated fat, energy, daily servings of fruits and vegetables and sugar-sweetened beverages, and frequency of fast-food intake. The primary independent variable was whether or not participants had children in their home by Year 7. Participants Two thousand five hundred sixty-three black and white adults who did not have children at baseline from four urban centers. Statistical analyses performed Linear regression adjusting for baseline demographics, energy intake, physical activity, and smoking status. Results Parents were more likely to be women, full-time workers, married, and older. Diet did not differ at baseline. Seven-year change in diet for parents and nonparents did not differ for fruit and vegetable, sugar-sweetened beverages, or fast food. Percent saturated fat decreased among both groups but parents showed a smaller decrease in percent saturated fat (1.59 vs 2.10; P < 0.001). Compared with nonparents, parents increased energy intake by 79 kcal/day (P=0.058), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions Parenthood does not have unfavorable effects on parents' diets, but neither does it lead to significant improvements. In fact, parents lag behind their childless counterparts in decreasing intake of saturated fat and overall diets remain poor. Nutrition education programs and food and nutrition practitioners should develop strategies to support and motivate healthy eating habits in parents.

METHODS: The study included American Black men (n = 571) and women (n = 791) aged 33 to 45 years in the CARDIA study. Perceived racial discrimination was assessed based on the Experiences of Discrimination scale (range, 1-35). CAC was evaluated using computed tomography. Primary analyses assessed associations between perceived racial discrimination and presence of CAC using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic position (SEP), psychosocial variables, and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors. RESULTS: In age- and gender-adjusted logistic regression models, odds of CAC decreased as the perceived racial discrimination score increased (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-0.98 per 1-unit increase in Experiences of Discrimination scale). The relationship did not markedly change after further adjustment for SEP, psychosocial variables, or CHD risk factors (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99).

Religious involvement has been associated with improved health outcomes but greater obesity in older adults. No longitudinal study of young adults has examined the prospective association of religious involvement with incident cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) and subclinical disease (subCVD). Methods. We included 2433 participants of the CARDIA study, aged 20 to 32 in 1987 when religiosity was assessed, who were followed for 18 years. Multivariable-adjusted regression models were fitted to assess prospective associations of frequency of religious participation at baseline with incidence of RFs and prevalence of subCVD after 18 years' follow up. Results. The high frequency of religious participation was associated with a significantly greater incidence of obesity in unadjusted models (RR 1.57, 95% Cl 1.14-1.73) and demographic-adjusted models (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09-1.65) but not after additional adjustment for baseline RFs (RR 1.17, 95% Cl .97-1.41). When religious participation was treated dichotomously, any religious participation, compared with none, was associated with significantly lower subCVD. Conclusions. Frequent religious participants are more likely to become obese between young adulthood and middle age; this association is confounded by demographic and other factors. Nonetheless, young adults with frequent participation may represent an opportunity for obesity prevention. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Sports Exerc., Vol. 44, No. 2, pp. 273-279, 2012. Introduction: Slow HR recovery (HRR) from a graded exercise treadmill test (GXT) is a marker of impaired parasympathetic reactivation that is associated with elevated mortality. Our objective was to test whether demographic, behavioral, or CHD risk factors during young adulthood were associated with the development of slow HRR. Methods: Participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study underwent symptom-limited maximal GXT using a modified Balke protocol at baseline (1985-1986) and 20-yr follow-up (2005-2006) examinations. HRR was calculated as the difference between peak HR and HR 2 min after cessation of the GXT. Slow HRR was defined as 2-min HRR <22 beats.min(-1). Results: In 2730 participants who did not have slow HRR at baseline, mean +/- SD HRR was 44 +/- 11 beats.min(-1) at baseline and declined to 40 T 12 beats.min(-1) in 2005-2006; slow HRR developed in 5% (n = 135) of the sample by 2005-2006. Female sex, black race, fewer years of education, obesity, cigarette smoking, higher depressive symptoms, higher fasting glucose, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and physical inactivity and low fitness were each associated with incident slow HRR. In a multivariable model, higher body mass index, larger waist, low education, fasting glucose, and current smoking remained significantly associated with incident slow HRR. Increasing body mass index (per SD higher) during follow-up and incident hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (in the subsets of participants who were free from those conditions at baseline) were each associated with significantly elevated odds of incident slow HRR. Conclusions: On average, HRR declines with aging; however, the odds of having slow HRR in early middle age is significantly associated with traditional CHD risk factors.",22,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0195-9131,1530-0315,MED SCI SPORT EXER,Med.

Results: Occupational mobility was unrelated to IMT save for an unexpected association of downward mobility with less CCA-IMT (beta = -0.04, p = .04). However, associations differed depending on initial standing (Year 5) and sex. For those with lower initial standings, upward mobility was associated with less CCA-IMT (beta = -0.07, p = .003), and downward mobility was associated with greater CCA-IMT and bulb-ICA-IMT (beta = 0.14, beta = .01 and beta = 0.14, p = .03, respectively); for those with higher standings, upward mobility was associated with greater CCA-IMT (beta = 0.15, p = .008), but downward mobility was unrelated to either IMT measure (p values > .20). Sex-specific analyses revealed associations of upward mobility with less CCA-IMT and bulb-ICA-IMT among men only (p values < .02). Conclusions: Occupational mobility may have implications for future cardiovascular health.

However, it is not clear whether this relationship is similar across varying levels of obesity. We hypothesized that lower amounts of LEFM is associated with higher insulin resistance (IR) and this association may vary according to weight status. Participants with available measures were examined from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (CARDIA), a multi-center longitudinal study of the etiology of atherosclerosis in black and white men and women aged 38-50 years old in 2005-2006 (n = 1,579). The homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA(IR)) was calculated to estimate IR, regional adiposity was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and weight status was defined according to BMI categories. Obese and overweight participants exhibited higher IR, total fat mass (FM), trunk FM (TFM), and LEFM compared to normal weight participants. After controlling for age, height, race, study center, education, smoking, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), greater LEFM was significantly associated with higher IR only in normal weight men and women. Further adjustment for TFM revealed that lower LEFM was significantly associated with higher IR in overweight and obese men and women and the positive association in normal weight individuals was attenuated. These results suggest that excess adiposity in the lower extremities may attenuate the metabolic risk observed at a given level of abdominal adiposity in overweight and obese individuals.

We tested the hypotheses that lower childhood SES and lower average education, occupation, and income and change in SES (slope) in adulthood are related to risk of CAC in blacks and whites in the US CARDIA study. Parental education and occupation were measured at study entry (Year 0 in 1985-1986) and participant education, occupation, and household income were evaluated multiple times throughout a 20 year follow-up period at four sites in the United States. CAC was measured at Year 20 in 3138 (45% black) participants in CARDIA; 19% had CAC. Latent growth models and multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for the major risk factors for CAC. Multivariate models showed that lower paternal education in blacks and lower maternal occupational status in the full sample and in whites were related to higher risk of any CAC, independent of adult SES. Lower average adult education, occupation, and income were related to higher risk of any CAC, with the effects primarily in blacks. Our results are the first to show that SES, measured retrospectively and prospectively in multiple ways, is related to CAC, and the first to document the effects primarily in blacks.

J,"Loucks, EB; Almeida, ND; Taylor, SE; Matthews, KA",Childhood Family Psychosocial Environment and Coronary Heart Disease Risk,PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE,Article,"Objective: Little is known about whether the childhood family psychosocial environment affects coronary heart disease (CHD). Study objectives were to evaluate associations of childhood family psychosocial environment (termed ""risky families""; characterized by cold, unaffectionate interactions, conflict, aggression, neglect, and/or low nurturance) with calculated risk for CHD. Methods: Study participants included 3554 participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, aged 33 to 45 years. Childhood family psychosocial environment was measured using a risky family questionnaire via self-report. Ten-year CHD risk was calculated using the validated Framingham risk algorithm. Results: In a multivariable-adjusted regression analysis adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and childhood socioeconomic position, a 1-unit (range, 0-21) increase in risky family score was associated with 1.0% (95% confidence interval = 0.4%-1.7%) and 1.0% (95% confidence interval = 0.2%-1.8%) higher CHD risk in women and men, respectively. Multiple mediation analyses suggested significant indirect effects of education, income, depressive symptomatology, and anger-out expression in women and education in men, indicating that these may be mediating mechanisms between childhood psychosocial environment and CHD risk. Of the modifiable Framingham algorithm components, smoking (in women and men) and high-density lipoprotein (in women) were the factors most strongly associated with risky family score. Conclusions: Childhood family psychosocial environment was positively associated with the calculated 10-year CHD risk. Mechanisms may include the potential negative impact of childhood family psychosocial environment on later-life socioeconomic position (e. g., education in men and women) and/or psychosocial functioning (e. g., depression and anger-out expression in women), which may in turn lead to higher CHD risk, particularly through smoking (in men and women) and low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (in women).",33,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0033-3174,,PSYCHOSOM MED,Psychosom.

Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC omega 3PUFAs), selenium (Se) and mercury (Hg) are three important components in fish. The cardioprotective effect of LC omega 3PUFA intake has been recognized; however, the hypothesis that this benefit may be greatest with high Se and low Hg levels has not been investigated. Design. A cohort of 4508 American adults aged 18-30, without hypertension at baseline in 1985, were enrolled. Six follow-ups were conducted at examinations in 1987, 1990, 1992, 1995, 2000 and 2005. Diet was assessed by a validated interviewer administered quantitative food frequency questionnaire at exams in 1985, 1992 and 2005. Incident hypertension was defined as first occurrence at any follow-up examination of systolic blood pressure (BP) >= 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP >= 90 mm Hg or taking antihypertensive medication. Toenail clippings were collected in 1987, and Se and Hg levels were quantified by instrumental neutron-activation analysis. Result. Participants in the highest LC omega 3PUFA intake quartile had a significantly lower incidence of hypertension (hazard ratio: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.53-0.79; P-trend < 0.01) compared to those in the lowest quartile after adjustment for potential confounders. Docosahexaenoic acid showed a greater inverse association than eicosapentaenoic acid. The inverse association of LC omega 3PUFA intake with hypertension appeared more pronounced at higher Se and lower Hg levels, although interaction tests were statistically nonsignificant.

This study analysed psychosocial pathways underlying racial differences in the impact of early heavy alcohol use on occupational and educational attainment at mid-life. Methods Outcomes in labor market participation, occupational prestige and educational attainment were measured in early and mid-adulthood. A mixture model was used to identify psychosocial classes that explain how race-specific differences in the relationship between drinking in early adulthood and occupational outcomes in mid-life operate. Data came from Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults, a longitudinal epidemiologic study. Results Especially for Blacks, heavy drinking in early adulthood was associated with a lower probability of being employed in mid-life. Among employed persons, there was a link between heavy drinking for both Whites and Blacks and decreased occupational attainment at mid-life. We grouped individuals into three distinct distress classes based on external stressors and indicators of internally generated stress. Blacks were more likely to belong to the higher distressed classes as were heavy drinkers in early adulthood. Stratifying the data by distress class, relationships between heavy drinking, race and heavy drinking-race interactions were overall weaker than in the pooled analysis.

We sought to determine whether ICAM1 SNPs are associated with circulating sICAM-1 concentration, coronary artery calcium (CAC), and common and internal carotid intima medial thickness (IMT). Methods and Results: 3550 black and white Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study subjects who participated in the year 15 and/or 20 examinations and were part of the Young Adult Longitudinal Study of Antioxidants (YALTA) ancillary study were included in this analysis. In whites, rs5498 was significantly associated with sICAM-1 (p < 0.001) and each G-allele of rs5498 was associated with 5% higher sICAM-1 concentration. In blacks, each C-allele of rs5490 was associated with 6% higher sICAM-1 level; this SNP was in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs5491, a functional variant. Subclinical measurements of atherosclerosis in either year 15 or year 20 were not significantly related to ICAM1 SNPs. Conclusions: In CARDIA, ICAM1 DNA segment variants were associated with sICAM-1 protein level including the novel finding that levels differ by the functional variant rs5491. However, ICAM1 SNPs were not strongly related to either IMT or CAC. Our findings in CARDIA suggest that ICAM1 variants are not major early contributors to subclinical atherosclerosis.

Objective: This study presented toenail Se distributions in American young adults of both genders, including both Caucasians and African Americans; and explored potential predictors of toenail Se levels. Data and methods: Data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study among 4252 American young adults, aged 20-32 in 1987 was used to examine toenail Se levels by instrumental neutron-activation analysis. The distribution of Se levels was described and multivariable linear regression was used to examine potential modifiers of toenail Se concentration within ethnicity-gender subgroups. Results: The geometric mean of toenail Se in this cohort was 0.844 mu g/g (95% CI, 0.840-0.849 mu g/g) and the median was 0.837 mu g/g (95% CI, 0.833-0.844 mu g/g). Median levels from lowest to highest quintile were 0.691, 0.774, 0.838, 0.913 and 1.037 mu g/g. Se levels varied geographically, and were generally in accordance with its concentrations in local soil. Males, African Americans, current smokers, heavy drinkers and less educated participants were more likely to have low Se levels. Conclusion: This study suggests that toenail Se levels vary geographically depending on soil Se concentrations. In addition to gender, ethnicity and education level, smoking status and alcohol consumption are two important indicators of Se status since they are modifiable lifestyle factors. Findings from this study might aid public health professionals in identifying people at relatively high or low Se levels, so that chronic disease prevention efforts can be directed toward these subgroups.

From questionnaire data, a total PA score was summarized in exercise units (EU) based on intensity and frequency of 13 PA categories. Using Geographic Information Systems, participants' residential locations were linked to county-level inflation-adjusted gasoline price data collected by the Council for Community & Economic Research. We used a random-effect longitudinal regression model to examine associations between time-varying gasoline price and time-varying PA, controlling for age, race, gender, baseline study center, and time-varying education, marital status, household income, county cost of living, county bus fare, census block-group poverty, and urbanicity. Results. Holding all control variables constant a 25-cent increase in inflation-adjusted gasoline price was significantly associated with an increase of 9.9 EU in total PA (95% CI: 0.8-19.1).

Further, little is known about the mechanisms by which neighborhood SES might influence health. Therefore, we estimated longitudinal relationships between neighborhood SES and physical activity (PA), a theorized mediator of the neighborhood SES-health association. We used data from four years of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (n = 5115, 18-30 years at baseline, 1985-1986), a cohort of U.S. young adults followed over 15 years, and a time-varying geographic information system. Using two longitudinal modeling strategies, this is the first study to explicitly examine how the estimated association between neighborhood SES (deprivation) and PA is biased by (a) measured characteristics theorized to influence residential decisions (e.g., controlling for individual SES, marriage, and children in random effects models), and (b) time-invariant, unmeasured characteristics (e.g., controlling for unmeasured motivation to exercise that is constant over time using repeated measures regression modeling, conditioned on the individual). After controlling for sociodemographics (age, sex, race) and individual SES, associations between higher neighborhood deprivation and lower PA were strong and incremental in blacks, but less consistent in whites. Furthermore, adjustment for measured characteristics beyond sociodemographics and individual SES had little influence on the estimated associations: adjustment for unmeasured characteristics attenuated negative associations more strongly in whites than in blacks.

Right ventricular end-diastolic area (RVED area) is known to identify pulmonary pathologies and have prognostic value for cardiovascular mortality in various disease states. To date, there is a paucity of adequately powered studies to define gender- and ethnicity-related differences in normal RVED area. Therefore, we derived gender-based normative values for echocardiographic measurements of RVED area, in a large bi-racial cohort of young adults. Methods: Healthy young adults participants (n = 2088) in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, aged 23-35 years, at the time of echocardiogram, were evaluated. RVED area was stratified according to gender and race. The contributions of clinical, allometric and left heart morphology and function to the variability in RVED area were determined. Results: RVED area in males was significantly larger than in females of similar age, but whites had similar values compared to same-gender blacks. RVED area for men and women of > 24.7 cm2 and 20.7cm2, or RVED area indexed to BSA (cm2/m2) of > 12.6 and > 11.7, respectively, are at the 97.5th percentile of normal values. RVED area correlated significantly with left ventricular volume and left atrial size. Lung capacity measured as FVC showed significant body size adjusted correlation with RVED area only in black males. Conclusions: This study provides normative values for echocardiographically defined RV end-diastolic area, and highlights the necessity to use gender-specific normative values.

The prevalence of nondipping in younger adults has not been well studied, nor has its value for predicting hypertension.

We used Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) conferred by nondipping for incident prehypertension or hypertension (preHTN/HTN) over 15 years. Of the 264 nonhypertensive participants at baseline, 118 (45%) were nondippers. Blacks were more likely than whites to be nondippers (52% versus 33%, P = .004). The incidence rate of preHTN/HTN was 29.2/1000 person-years among dippers and 36.2/1000 person-years among nondippers. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of nighttime to daytime SBP, those in the highest quartile were more likely to develop preHTN/HTN (HR 1.61; P = .06), but this relationship was attenuated after adjustment (HR 1.34; P = .27).

METHODS: We estimated the association of PCOS with incident diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension over a period of 18 years among 1,127 white and African-American women in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort. We classified women at baseline (ages 20-32 years) based on self-reported symptoms and serum androgen measures using National Institutes of Health PCOS criteria. We estimated the association of PCOS and subsequent cardiovascular risk factors, independent of baseline body mass index (BMI), using multivariable logistic regression. Additionally, among 746 women with a second assessment of PCOS at ages 34-46 years, we estimated the association of persistent PCOS with cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Of 1,127 women, 53 (4.7%) met criteria for PCOS at ages 20-32 years. Polycystic ovary syndrome was associated with a twofold higher odds of incident diabetes (23.1% compared with 13.1%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.4, confidence interval [CI] 1.2-4.9) and dyslipidemia (41.9% compared with 27.7%, AOR 1.9, CI 1.0-3.6) over the course of 18 years; the association with incident hypertension was not significant (26.9% compared with 26.3%, AOR 1.7, CI 0.8-3.3). Normal-weight women with PCOS (n = 31) had a threefold higher odds of incident diabetes compared with normal-weight women without PCOS (AOR 3.1, CI 1.2-8.0). Compared with those without PCOS, women with persistent PCOS (n = 11) had the highest odds of diabetes (AOR 7.2, CI 1.1-46.5). CONCLUSION: Polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with subsequent incident diabetes and dyslipidemia, independent of BMI. Diabetes risk may be greatest for women with persistent PCOS symptoms.

Purpose: The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of weight-loss maintenance in a biracial cohort of younger adults. Methods: This study examined a population-based sample of overweight/obese African-American and white men and women who had >= 5% weight loss between 1995 and 2000. Subsequent changes in weight, physical activity, and behavioral and psychosocial factors were examined between 2000 and 2005. Analyses were conducted in 2008-2009. Results: Among the 1869 overweight/obese individuals without major disease in 1995, a total of 536 (29%) lost >= 5% between 1995 and 2000. Among those who lost weight, 34% (n=180) maintained at least 75% of their weight loss between 2000 and 2005, whereas 66% subsequently regained. Higher odds of successful weight-loss maintenance were related to African-American race (OR=1.7, p=0.03); smoking (OR=3.4, p=0.0001); history of diabetes (OR=2.2, p=0.04); increases in moderate physical activity between 2000 and 2005 (OR=1.4, p=0.005); increases in emotional support over the same period (OR=1.6, p=0.01); and less sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption in 2005 (OR=0.8, p=0.006). Conclusions: One third of overweight men and women who lost weight were able to maintain 75% or more of their weight loss over 5 years. Interventions to promote weight-loss maintenance may benefit from targeting increased physical activity and emotional support and decreased sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption.

This study uses longitudinal data from 1985 to 2001 to empirically assess the impact of distance from place of residence to bars on alcohol consumption in four large U.S. cities from 1985 to 2001. Density of bars within 0.5 km of a person's residence is associated with small increases in alcohol consumption as measured by: daily alcohol consumption (ml) drinks per week, and weekly consumption of beer, wine, and liquor. When person-specific fixed effects are included, the relationship between alcohol consumption and the number of bars within a 0.5 km radius of the person's place of residence disappears. Tests for endogeneity of the number of bars within the immediate vicinity of respondents' homes fail to reject the null hypothesis that the number of bars is exogenous.

The relationships of SU with categories of beer, liquor, wine and total alcohol intake referent to no intake were examined in sex-specific, cross-sectional analyses. Results Mean age (SD) at the beginning of follow-up was 25.1 (3.6) years. Compared with non-drinkers, significant associations between higher SU concentrations and greater beer intake were observed among men and women, with more pronounced and consistent associations for women. An association between greater liquor intake and higher SU concentrations was only seen for men at the year 20 evaluation. Wine intake was not associated with SU in either sex and total alcohol was associated with higher SU concentrations in both men and women. The magnitude of the associations between alcoholic beverages intake and SU was modest (<= 0.03 mg/dl/alcoholic beverage serving).

Pre-pregnancy stress reactivity and pregnancy outcome. Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 2010; 24: 564-571. Stress has been proposed as a cause of preterm birth (PTB) and small-for-gestational age (SGA), but stress does not have the same effects on all women. It may be that a woman's reaction to stress relates to her pregnancy health, and previous studies indicate that higher reactivity is associated with reduced birthweight and gestational age. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between pre-pregnancy cardiovascular reactivity to stress and pregnancy outcome. The sample included 917 women in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study who had cardiovascular reactivity measured in 1987-88 and at least one subsequent singleton livebirth within an 18-year period. Cardiovascular reactivity was measured using a video game, star tracing and cold pressor test. Gestational age and birthweight were based on the women's self-report, with PTB defined as birth < 37 weeks' gestation and SGA as weight < 10th percentile for gestational age. Linear and Poisson regression and generalised estimating equations were used to model the relationship between reactivity to stress and birth outcomes with control for confounders. Few associations were seen between reactivity and pregnancy outcomes. Higher pre-pregnancy diastolic blood pressure (adjusted relative risk 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98, 1.34) and mean arterial pressure reactivity (1.15; 0.98, 1.36) were associated with risk of PTB at first pregnancy, while SGA was associated with lower systolic blood pressure reactivity (0.76; 0.60, 0.95). No associations were seen with other measures of reactivity. Contrary to hypothesis, the association between heart rate reactivity and PTB in first pregnancy was stronger in whites (adjusted relative risk 1.39; 1.03, 1.88) than in blacks (1.00; 0.83, 1.20; P for interaction = 0.08). Similar results were found for mean arterial pressure. No strong associations were found between higher pre-pregnancy stress reactivity and SGA or PTB, and stress reactivity did not have a stronger association with birth outcomes in blacks than whites.",5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-5022,1365-3016,PAEDIATR PERINAT EP,Paediatr.

Methods: Using data from 2,544 healthy participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (ages, 33-45 years; 55% female; 42% black), we examined the prospective association of depressive symptoms, as measured by the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, with circulating CRP 5 years later. Results: Depressive symptoms in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study Year 15 predicted CRP at Year 20, independent of demographic characteristics, biological and medical risk factors, health behaviors, and Year 15 CRP. This association, however, was conditional on race such that the increase in CRP with increasing depressive symptoms was present in blacks but not whites. In neither blacks nor whites did Year 15 CRP predict Year 20 depressive symptoms. Among black participants, when examined in separate analyses, higher scores on the depressed affect and somatic symptoms subscales of the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and lower scores on the positive affect subscale were associated with greater Year 20 CRP. The interpersonal problems subscale was unrelated to CRP. When all four subscale scores were entered simultaneously in the same model, black participants' scores on the positive affect and somatic symptoms subscales emerged as independent predictors of Year 20 CRP, whereas the depressed affect and interpersonal problems subscales did not.

The aim of this study was to compare young adults with low cardiovascular risk (body mass index, 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2); blood pressure < 120/80 mmHg; no tobacco use, no diabetes, and physical fitness) with those without these characteristics with regard to LV mass and relative wall thickness and LA size, to determine the protective effect of a healthy lifestyle on the development of these characteristics. Methods: Cross-sectional assessment of 4059 black and white men and women aged 23 to 35 years in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study at the year 5-examination, when risk factors were measured, and echocardiography to assess LV mass and relative wall thickness were performed. Physical fitness was measured at baseline using a symptom-limited maximal treadmill test. All other covariates were measured concurrently with echocardiography. Results: Gender, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure were associated with LV mass and relative wall thickness and LA size in multivariate models. Additional correlates of LV mass/height(2.7) ratio were tobacco use, resting heart rate (inverse), self-reported physical activity, gender (male higher), and age. Age was associated with LV relative wall thickness but not other measures of LV size. Additional correlates of LA diameter/height ratio were tobacco use, resting heart rate (inverse), serum glucose, and self-reported physical activity. Seven hundred ninety of 4059 subjects (19%) were classified as having low risk; black race was less likely in the low-risk group. Those with low risk had lower LV mass/height(2.7) ratios (32.0 vs 34.6 g/m(2.7), P < .0001), better LV relative wall thickness (0.33 vs 0.35, P < .0001), and lower LA diameter/height ratios (2.02 vs 2.08 cm/m, P < .01). Conclusions: A low cardiovascular risk profile in young adulthood is associated with more favorable LV mass, LV relative wall thickness, and LA size.

Longitudinal Examination of Age-Predicted Symptom-Limited Exercise Maximum HR. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 42, No. 8, pp. 1519-1527, 2010. Purpose: To estimate the association of age with maximal HR (MHR). Methods: Data were obtained from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Participants were black and white men and women aged 18-30 yr in 1985-1986 (year 0). A symptom-limited maximal graded exercise test was completed at years 0, 7, and 20 by 4969, 2583, and 2870 participants, respectively. After exclusion, 9622 eligible tests remained. Results: In all 9622 tests, estimated MHR (eMHR, bpm) had a quadratic relation to age in the age range of 18-50 yr, eMHR = 179 + 0.29 x age - 0.011 x age(2). The age-MHR association was approximately linear in the restricted age ranges of consecutive tests. In 2215 people who completed tests of both years 0 and 7 (age range = 18-37 yr), eMHR = 189 - 0.35 x age; and in 1574 people who completed tests of both years 7 and 20 (age range = 25-50 yr), eMHR = 199 - 0.63 x age. In the lowest baseline body mass index (BMI) quartile, the rate of decline was 0.24 bpm.yr(-1) between years 0 and 7 and 0.51 bpm.yr(-1) between years 7 and 20, whereas in the highest baseline BMI quartile, there was a linear rate of decline of approximately 0.7 bpm.yr(-1) for the full age range of 18-50 yr. Conclusions: Clinicians making exercise prescriptions should be aware that the loss of symptom-limited MHR is much slower in young adulthood and more pronounced in later adulthood.

A similar trend was observed in blacks who consistently maintained a body mass index less than 25 kg/m(2) over the study period. These data support a role of INSIG2 sequence variation in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

How best to operationalize allostatic load, however, remains the subject of some debate. We sought to test a hypothesized metafactor model of allostatic load composed of a number of biological system factors, and to investigate model invariance across sex and ethnicity. Biological data from 782 men and women, aged 32-47, from the Oakland, CA and Chicago, IL sites of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA) were collected as part of the Year 15 exam in 2000. These include measures of blood pressure, metabolic parameters (glucose, insulin, lipid profiles, and waist circumference), markers of inflammation (interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen), heart rate variability, sympathetic nervous system activity (12-hr urinary norepinephrine and epinephrine) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity (diurnal salivary free cortisol). A ""metafactor"" model of AL as an aggregate measure of six underlying latent biological subfactors was found to fit the data, with the metafactor structure capturing 84% of variance of all pairwise associations among biological subsystems. There was little evidence of model variance across sex and/or ethnicity. These analyses extend work operationalizing AL as a multisystems index of biological dysregulation, providing initial support for a model of AL as a metaconstruct of inter-relationships among multiple biological regulatory systems, that varies little across sex or ethnicity.

Methods: Toenail selenium concentrations were examined among 3112 Americans age 20-32 years in 1987 and measured by instrumental neutron-activation analysis. Subclinical atherosclerosis, including common, bulb and internal carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), was measured in 2005 and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score in 2000 and 2005. General linear regression was developed examining the relation between toenail selenium levels and CIMTs, and logistic regression for repeated outcomes was employed estimating the risk of having CAC > 0. Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, no associations were observed between toenail selenium levels and CIMTs as well as CAC score. Comparing participants in the highest with the lowest quintile of selenium, the CIMT was 0.005 mm (SE = 0.008 mm, P(trend) = 0.39), 0.018 mm (SE = 0.019 mm, P(trend) = 0.49), and 0.017 mm (SE = 0.014 mm, P(trend) = 0.21) thicker measured in common, bulb and internal carotid, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio of having CAC > 0 was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.67-1.35; P(trend) = 0.999). Conclusions: No associations were observed between toenail selenium and measures of subclinical atherosclerosis among American young adults. This study does not support an atherosclerotic mechanism of selenium for risk reduction of cardiovascular disease. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epidemiology studies initiated before adoption of the 1987 American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines typically used a 1 or 2s plateau on the volume-time curve, not a minimum test duration of 6 s, to terminate a test. Objectives: To determine the effect of changing guidelines on FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC during a longitudinal study of young adults. Methods: Spirometry was performed on participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Values obtained at entry and 2, 5 and 10 years later using accepted procedures were re-evaluated using the 2005 ATS ERS guidelines, which were in effect for the year 20 exam. Generalized estimating equations were used to adjust tests with short exhalations that were acceptable by then current end of test criteria. Results: The percentage of participants at years 0, 2, 5, and 10 with exhalations less than 6 s but with an acceptable plateau was 33%, 29%, 9%, and 2%, respectively. Exhalations less than 6 s occurred more frequently in younger and female participants, and were associated with lower FVC and higher FEV1/FVC. For short exhalations the adjusted FVC was 47 ml and 110 ml higher than the measured FVC when 6 and 8 s exhalation times were used. Conclusions: In longitudinal studies of young adults, changing end of test criteria may affect lung function, especially among younger and female participants. Determining adjusted values for tests with short exhalations may better represent the lung health of participants. (C)) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To determine in a prospective cohort of generally healthy young adults the influence of early adult lung function on the presence of airflow obstruction in middle age. METHODS: A longitudinal study was performed of 2496 adults who were 18 to 30 years of age at entry, did not report having asthma, and returned at year 20. Airflow obstruction was defined as an forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio less than the lower limit of normal. RESULTS: Airflow obstruction was present in 6.9% and 7.8% of participants at years 0 and 20, respectively. Less than 10% of participants with airflow obstruction self-reported chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In cross-sectional analyses, airflow obstruction was associated with less education, smoking, and self-reported chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Low forced expiratory volume in I second, forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio, and airflow obstruction in young adults were associated with low lung function and airflow obstruction 20 years later. Of those with airflow obstruction at year 0, 52% had airflow obstruction 20 years later. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity at year 0 was highly predictive of airflow obstruction 20 years later (c-statistic 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-0.93). The effect of cigarette smoking on lung function decline with age was most evident in young adults with preexisting airflow obstruction. CONCLUSION: Airflow obstruction is mostly unrecognized in young and middle-aged adults. Low forced expiratory volume in 1 second, low forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio, airflow obstruction in young adults, and smoking are highly predictive of low lung function and airflow obstruction in middle age.

METHODS: With the use of data from the baseline and year-10 exams of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, confirmatory factor analysis was performed overall and for race- and sex-specific groups for one-, two-, three-, and four-factor MetS models in 3403 white and black men and women at baseline and in 2532 white and black men and women 10 years later. Metabolic risk variables used in the factor analysis were insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, triceps skinfolds, and uric acid. RESULTS: Three- and four-factor models of MetS achieved excellent fits of the data, ranging from 0.92 to 0.96 for race- and sex-specific models and from the baseline to year-10 exams. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that MetS factors are consistent across time and race-sex groups. When investigating the MetS, it is necessary to evaluate race-sex groups.

This study examined the longitudinal relationship between waist circumference (WC) and insulin resistance using three dimensions of WC: baseline WC, slope of linear changes in WC, and fluctuation of WC around the slope during 20 years of follow-up. Anthropometry, insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment (HOMA(IR))), and lifestyle factors were obtained in a population-based, prospective observational study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA)) during 1985-2006, excluding participants who had been diagnosed with diabetes at any examination. After adjusting for socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, the evolution of HOMA(IR) from CARDIA year 15 to 20 was 6.9% higher per standard deviation of year 0 WC (P trend < 0.0001) and 6.3% higher per standard deviation increase in the change in WC over the long term (P trend < 0.0001). However, WC fluctuations around the linear change were not associated with insulin resistance or its evolution. The level of HOMA(IR) increased substantially with steeper linear WC slope among initially thinner participants at baseline, whereas this association tended to be weaker in those with higher initial WC (P interaction < 0.0001).

Although the underlying biological mechanism is unknown, increases in inflammation have been implicated. This prospective study examined the association between C-reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker of systemic inflammation, and fatigue 5 years later. Methods: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is a population-based longitudinal study conducted in four U.S. cities. Highly sensitive CRP concentration and fatigue were measured in 2983 African American and white adults at both year 15 (2000-2001, ages 33-45 years) and year 20 (2005-2006) examinations. Fatigue was assessed using the vitality subscale of the 12-item Short Form Health Survey. Results: Plasma CRP concentration at baseline (i.e., CARDIA year 15) was a significant predictor of fatigue level 5 years later (unadjusted beta = .126, p < .001). After adjustment for potential confounders, this association remained significant (adjusted beta = .044, p = .033). Additionally, baseline CRP independently predicted fatigue in the subgroup of participants without medical comorbidity (adjusted beta = .051, p = .039). Fatigue was associated with a persistent elevation of CRP at both examinations but not with a transient elevation of CRP at only one of the examinations. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate a prospective association between an inflammatory marker and fatigue in a general population. Furthermore, the association between low-grade systemic inflammation and fatigue seems primarily driven by persistent immune activation and not explained by the presence or development of medical comorbidity.",27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Methods: Year-20 data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (3549 black and white adults aged 38-50 years in 2005-2006) were analyzed in 2008-2009. Sociodemographic correlates of transportation mode (car-only, walk-only, any cycling, other) to neighborhood amenities were examined in multivariable multinomial logistic models. Gender-stratified multivariable linear or multinomial regression models compared CVD risk factors across transit modes. Results: Active transit was most common to parks and public transit stops; walking was more common than cycling. Among those who used each amenity, active transit (walk-only and any cycling versus car-only transit) was more common in men and those with no live-in partner and less than full-time employment (significant ORs [95% CI] ranging from 1.56 [1.08, 2.27] to 4.54 [1.70, 12-14]), and less common in those with children. Active transit to any neighborhood amenity was associated with more favorable BMI, waist circumference, and fitness (largest coefficient [95% CI] -1.68 [-2.81, -0.55] for BMI, -3.41 [-5.71, -1.11] for waist circumference [cm], and 36.65 [17.99, 55.31.] for treadmill test duration [seconds]). Only cycling was associated with lower lifetime CVD risk classification. Conclusions: Active transit to neighborhood amenities was related to sociodemographics and CVD risk factors. Variation in health-related benefits by active transit mode, if validated in prospective studies, may have implications for transportation planning and research.

In cross-sectional analysis, multivariable linear regression with adjustment for age, BMI. smoking status. alcohol intake. and nutritional factors was used to relate log CRP the independent variable, to IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in a sample of black (n = 364) and white men (n = 486) separately by race Results. Only black men had positive findings: log CRP was significantly associated with IGF-I (beta= -131 ng/ml, p = 0.02) and the difference in mean IGF-I concentrations between the highest and lowest quartiles of CRP was 26 ng/ml There was a statistically significant interaction between log CRP and smoking status (p = 0.02). the regression coefficient for IGF-I predicted from log CRP was significant ill smokers (beta = 39.8 ng/ml, p = 0 0001), but not in non-smokers. The difference in mean IGF-I concentrations between highest and lowest quartiles of CRP was 100 ng/ml for black smokers. There were no associations for IGFBP-3. Conclusions: In our study, CRP levels are inversely associated with IGF-I concentrations in black male smokers: however, the causal nature of the association is unclear and Should be studied further.

We assessed multivariable-adjusted associations of fish consumption and dietary intakes of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with depressive symptoms in a population-based sample of 3317 African-American and Caucasian men and women from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. Methods: Diet was assessed in year 7 (1992-1993) and depressive symptoms were measured in years 10 (1995-1996), 15 (2000-2001), and 20 (2005-2006) by the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Depressive symptoms were defined as a Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score >= 16 or self-reported use of antidepressant medication. Results: In the entire cohort, the highest quintiles of intakes of EPA (0.03% energy), DHA (>= 0.05% energy), and EPA + DHA (>= 0.08% energy) were associated with a lower risk of depressive symptoms at year 10 (P for trends = 0.16, 0.10, and 0.03, respectively). The observed inverse associations were more pronounced in women. For the total number of occasions with depressive symptoms, the multivariable adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) in women were 0.75 (0.55-1.01) for fish intake, 0.66 (0.50-0.89) for EPA, 0.66 (0.49-0.89) for DHA, and 0.71 (0.52-0.95) for EPA + DHA when comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles. Analyses of continuous Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale scores revealed inverse associations with fourth-root-transformed omega-3 variables in women.

We determined the cross-sectional associations of the FABP2 gene with lipid levels and insulin resistance in 2148 participants who completed the year-20 examination of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. No significant difference in total cholesterol, low-density or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to total cholesterol ratio, or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was found between FABP2 genotypes. However, in the presence of a high-saturated fat diet (>= 53.2 g/d, the 90th percentile for the population), the AA/AG genotypes (carriers of the Thr54 allele) of FABP2 had statistically significantly higher levels of log(HOMA-IR) (P = .006) and a lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to total cholesterol ratio (P = .03), and borderline statistically significantly higher levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and log(triglycerides) (P values = .08, .07, and .05, respectively) compared with those with the GG genotype (Ala54 homozygotes). Lipid levels and log(HOMA-IR) did not vary by genotype with saturated fat intake less than 53.2 g/d. Limiting dietary saturated fat intake may be particularly important among carriers of the A allele of FABP2. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

STUDY DESIGN: In 1451 nulliparas who were aged 18-30 years and free of the MetS at baseline (1985-1986) and reexamined up to 4 times during 20 years, we ascertained incident MetS defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria among time-dependent interim birth groups by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM): (0 [referent], 1 non-GDM, 2+ non-GDM, 1 + GDM births). Complementary log-log models estimated relative hazards of the MetS among birth groups adjusted for race, age, and baseline and follow-up covariates. RESULTS: We identified 259 incident MetS cases in 25,246 person-years (10.3/1000 person-years). Compared with 0 births, adjusted relative hazards (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 1.33 (95% CI, 0.931.90) for 1 non-GDM, 1.62 (95% CI, 1.16-2.26) for 2+ non-GDM (P trend = .02), and 2.43 (95% CI, 1.53-3.86) for 1+ GDM births.

Growing evidence also suggests SES gradients in levels of peripheral blood markers of inflammation. However, we know little about potential gender and racial/ethnic differences in associations between SES and inflammation, despite the fact that the burden of inflammation-related diseases varies by gender and race. The present study examines SES (education and income) gradients in levels of two inflammatory biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in a biethnic (White and Black) sample of men and women (n = 3549, aged 37-55 years) in the USA from the CARDIA Study. Health status, behavioral and psychosocial variables that may underlie SES differences in inflammatory biomarker levels were also examined. Age-adjusted CRP and IL-6 levels were inversely associated with education level in each race/gender group except Black males. income gradients were also observed in each race/gender group for IL-6 and in White females and males for CRP. In general, differences in CRP and IL-6 levels between low and high SES groups were reduced in magnitude and significance with the addition of health status, behavioral, and psychosocial variables, although the impact of the addition of model covariates varied across race/gender groups and different SES-inflammation models. Overall, findings indicate SES gradients in levels of inflammation burden in middle-aged White and Black males and females. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We also examine whether the proposed associations are mediated by smoking, alcohol consumption, and depression. Risk for chronic disease increases with decreasing SES. One pathway by which low SES might influence disease risk is by promoting oxidative stress. Methods: Data from 1278 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study Were used to examine the association of SES with oxidation correlates and antioxidant nutrients. Education, occupation, health behaviors, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed during Years 0, 10, and 15 of the study, income and depression were evaluated at Years 10 and 15. F(2-)isoprostanes were measured at Year 15, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) at Years 0 and 10, carotenoids at Years 0 and 15, and ascorbic acid at Years 10 and 15. Results: Cross sectionally, oxidation correlates decreased and antioxidant nutrients increased with increasing SES, estimated in several ways, independent of age, sex.. race, and BMI Prospectively, lower Year 0 education and occupation predicted greater increases in GIST and greater decreases in carotenoids over 10 to 15 years. prospective associations of Year 0 SES with Year 15 carotenoids were independent of Year 15 SES.

Design: Participants (N = 2,738) completed measures of childhood family environment, parental education, health behavior, and adult negative emotionality. Main Outcome Measures: These variables were used to predict initial systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively) and the rate of blood pressure change over 10 years. Results: Structural equation modeling indicated that family environment was related to negative emotions, which in turn predicted baseline DBP and SBP and change in SBP. Parental education directly predicted change in SBP. Although African American participants had higher SBP and DBP and steeper increases over time, multiple group comparisons indicated that the strength of most pathways was similar across race and gender.

Methods We prospectively assessed the incidence of heart failure over a 20-year period among 5115 blacks and whites of both sexes who were 18 to 30 years of age at baseline. Using Cox models, we examined predictors of hospitalization or death from heart failure. Results Over the course of 20 years, heart failure developed in 27 participants (mean [+/- SD] age at onset, 39 +/- 6 years), all but 1 of whom were black. The cumulative incidence of heart failure before the age of 50 years was 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 1.7) in black women, 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5 to 1.4) in black men, 0.08% (95% CI, 0.0 to 0.5) in white women, and 0% (95% CI, 0 to 0.4) in white men (P = 0.001 for the comparison of black participants and white participants). Among blacks, independent predictors at 18 to 30 years of age of heart failure occurring 15 years, on average, later included higher diastolic blood pressure (hazard ratio per 10.0 mm Hg, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.1), higher body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) (hazard ratio per 5.7 units, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.9), lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hazard ratio per 13.3 mg per deciliter [0.34 mmol per liter], 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4 to 1.0), and kidney disease (hazard ratio, 19.8; 95% CI, 4.5 to 87.2). Three quarters of those in whom heart failure subsequently developed had hypertension by the time they were 40 years of age. Depressed systolic function, as assessed on a study echocardiogram when the participants were 23 to 35 years of age, was independently associated with the development of heart failure 10 years, on average, later (hazard ratio for abnormal systolic function, 36.9; 95% CI, 6.9 to 198.3; hazard ratio for borderline systolic function, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 10.2). Myocardial infarction, drug use, and alcohol use were not associated with the risk of heart failure. Conclusions Incident heart failure before 50 years of age is substantially more common among blacks than among whites. Hypertension, obesity, and systolic dysfunction that are present before a person is 35 years of age are important antecedents that may be targets for the prevention of heart failure.

We investigated the relation of cardiorespiratory fitness to coronary artery calcification (CAC) in 2373 African-American and White young adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. We measured cardiorespiratory fitness in 1985-1986 (baseline) using a symptom-limited exercise test on a treadmill. Coronary calcium scores were measured in 2001-2002 (year 15) using electron-beam or multi-detector computed tomography. CAC was classified as present or absent, while cardiorespiratory fitness was classified as sex-specific low, moderate, and high fitness categories. After adjustment for age, sex, race, clinical center, education, cigarette smoking, waist girth, alcohol intake, physical activity, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes mellitus, and fasting insulin, baseline cardiorespiratory fitness was inversely associated with prevalence of CAC in young adults (P for trend = 0.03).

However, whether IL1B genetic variation is associated with CRP level is unknown. Further, obesity, a state of low-grade inflammation that influences cellular IL-1 functions may modify this association. Methods and results: Study participants (N=3289), 48% blacks and 52% whites, had CRP level measurements at year 7 and year 15 examinations as part of the CARDIA study. Ten tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that characterize common IL1B gene variation were genotyped. In SNP analysis, no significant associations with either level or change in time CRP were observed after multiple testing adjustments. However, global IL1B gene variation was associated with year 7 to year 15 change in CRP (global nominal p=0.004, multiple testing corrected p=0.048) among obese blacks. Compared to the commonest haplotype, a common haplotype that includes the SNP rs1143642 was associated with greater increases in CRP from year 7 to year 15 among obese blacks and whites while another common haplotype that includes the SNP rs3917356 was associated with decreased change in CRP from year 7 to year 15 among obese blacks. The rare alleles of IL1B SNPs, SNP 7114 (rs1143642) and SNP 3298 (rs3917356), were associated with greater increases and decreases ill CRP from year 7 to year 15 among blacks, respectively, compared to their common variants.

Methods: Fibrinogen, factors VII (FVII) and VIII (FVIII), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were measured in 1396 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) and carotid intimal/medial thickness (CIMT) were determined 13 years later. The adjusted prevalence of CAC and mean CIMT across the quartiles of each hemostatic factor was computed for the total sample and for each race and gender group. Results: The age-, race-, and gender-adjusted prevalences of CAC with increasing quartiles of fibrinogen were 14.4%, 15.2%, 20.0%, and 29.1% (p<0.001 for trend). This trend persisted after further adjustment for body mass index (BMI), smoking, educational level, center, systolic blood pressure (BP), diabetes, antihypertensive medication use, total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and CRP. A similar trend was observed for CIMT (age-, race- and gender-adjusted, p<0.001; multivariable-adjusted, p=0.014). Further analyses of race and gender subgroups showed that increasing quartiles of fibrinogen were associated with CAC and CIMT in all subgroups except black men. The prevalence of CAC was not associated with increasing quartiles of FVII, FVIII, or vWF, suggesting they may be less involved in plaque progression. Conclusion: An elevated fibrinogen concentration in persons aged 25-37 is independently associated with subclinical cardiovascular disease in the subsequent decade. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Thus, we examined the association of circulating carotenoids with hypertension, a major macrovascular disease risk factor. Methods Black and White men and women in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, aged 18-30 years at recruitment (1985-1986) from four US cities, were investigated over 20 years. At years 0, 7, and 15, we determined the relationships of the sum of four serum carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin, cryptoxanthin) and of lycopene with incident hypertension using proportional hazards regression models. Results In 4412 participants, year 0 sum of four carotenoids was significantly inversely associated with 20-year hypertension incidence after adjustment for baseline systolic blood pressure and other confounding factors ( relative hazard per SD increase of sum of four carotenoids: 0.91; 95% confidence interval=0.84-0.99). The inverse relationships persisted in time-dependent models updating year 0 sum of four carotenoids with year 7 and year 15 values ( relative hazard per SD increase of sum of four carotenoids: 0.84; 95% confidence interval=0.77-0.92). Lycopene was unrelated to hypertension in any model.

Recent studies have found that sleep duration is correlated with established risk factors for calcification including glucose regulation, blood pressure, sex, age, education, and body mass index. Objective To determine whether objective and subjective measures of sleep duration and quality are associated with incidence of calcification over 5 years and whether calcification risk factors mediate the association. Design, Setting, and Participants Observational cohort of home monitoring in a healthy middle- aged population of 495 participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ( CARDIA) cohort Chicago site ( black and white men and women aged 35- 47 years at year 15 of the study in 2000- 2001 with follow- up data at year 20 in 2005- 2006). Potential confounders ( age, sex, race, education, apnea risk, smoking status) and mediators ( lipids, blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes, inflammatory markers, alcohol consumption, depression, hostility, selfreported medical conditions) were measured at both baseline and follow- up. Sleep metrics ( wrist actigraphy measured duration and fragmentation, daytime sleepiness, overall quality, self- reported duration) were examined for association with incident calcification. Participants had no detectable calcification at baseline. Main Outcome Measure Coronary artery calcification was measured by computed tomography in 2000- 2001 and 2005- 2006 and incidence of new calcification over that time was the primary outcome. Results Five- year calcification incidence was 12.3% ( n= 61). Longer measured sleep duration was significantly associated with reduced calcification incidence ( adjusted odds ratio, 0.67 per hour [ 95% confidence interval, 0.49- 0.91 per hour]; P=. 01). No potential mediators appreciably altered the magnitude or significance of sleep ( adjusted odds ratio estimates ranged from 0.64 to 0.68 per sleep hour; maximum P=. 02).

METHODS: This was a prospective, population-based, observational cohort of 2,304 (1,167 black, 1,137 white) women (aged 18-30 years) who were free of hypertension at baseline (1985-1986) and reexamined up to six times at 2, 5, 7, 10, or 20 years later (2005-2006). We obtained standardized blood pressure measurements before and after pregnancies and categorized women into time-dependent groups by the cumulative number of births since baseline within each time interval (zero births [referent]; one interim birth and two or more interim births; nonhypertensive pregnancies). The study assessed differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressures among interim birth groups using multivariable, repeated measures linear regression models stratified by baseline parity (nulliparous and parous), adjusted for time, age, race, baseline covariates (blood pressure, body mass index, education, and oral contraceptive use), and follow-up covariates (smoking, anti hypertensive medications, oral contraceptive use, and weight gain). RESULTS: Among nulliparas at baseline, mean (95% confidence interval) fully adjusted systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mm Hg), respectively, were lower by -2.06 (-2.72 to -1.41) and -1.50 (-2.08 to -0.92) after one interim birth, and lower by -1.89 (-2.63 to -1.15) and -1.29 (-1.96 to -0.63) after two or more interim births compared with no births (all P <.001). Among women already parous at baseline, adjusted mean blood pressure changes did not differ by number of subsequent births. CONCLUSION: A first birth is accompanied by persistent lowering of blood pressure from preconception to years after delivery. Although the biologic mechanism is unclear, pregnancy may create enduring alterations in vascular endothelial function.",36,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0029-7844,,OBSTET GYNECOL,Obstet.

J,"Lauderdale, DS; Knutson, KL; Yan, LL; Liu, K; Rathouz, PJ",Self-Reported and Measured Sleep Duration How Similar Are They?,EPIDEMIOLOGY,Article,"Background: Recent epidemiologic studies have found that self-reported duration of sleep is associated with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and mortality. The extent to which self reports of sleep duration are similar to objective measures and whether individual characteristics influence the degree of similarity are not known. Methods: Eligible participants at the Chicago site of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study were invited to participate in a 2003-2005 ancillary sleep study; 82% (n = 669) agreed. Sleep measurements collected in 2 waves included 3 days each of wrist actigraphy, a sleep log, and questions about usual sleep duration. We estimate the average difference and correlation between subjectively and objectively measured sleep by using errors-in-variables regression models. Results: Average measured sleep was 6 hours, whereas the average from subjective reports was 6.8 hours. Subjective reports increased on average by 34 minutes for each additional hour of measured sleep. Overall, the correlation between reported and measured sleep duration was 0.47. Our model suggests that persons sleeping 5 hours over-reported their sleep duration by 1.2 hours, and those sleeping 7 hours over-reported by 0.4 hours. The correlations and average differences between self-reports and measured sleep varied by health, sociodemographic, and sleep characteristics. Conclusion: In a population-based sample of middle-aged adults, subjective reports of habitual sleep are moderately correlated with actigraph-measured sleep, but are biased by systematic over-reporting.

Design: A cross-sectional analysis of data from the longitudinal Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a prospective, epidemiologic investigation of the determinants and evolution of cardiovascular risk factors among black and white young adults and from the ancillary CARDIA Women's Study (CWS). Setting: Population-based sample from four US communities (Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; Oakland, CA). Patient(s): Women aged 33-44 years who had complete data (n = 764). Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Self-report of ever having unprotected sexual intercourse for at least 12 months without becoming pregnant. Result(S): Among nonsurgically sterile women, blacks had a twofold increased odds (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-3.1) of infertility compared with whites after adjustment for socioeconomic position (education and ability to pay for basics), correlates of pregnancy intent (marital status and hormonal contraceptive use), and risk factors for infertility (age, smoking, T, fibroid presence, and ovarian volume). The corresponding odds ratio among all women was 1.5 (95% CI 1.0-2.2). Difficulty paying for basics and ovarian volume were associated with infertility among black but not white women.

Similarly, cardiac autonomic regulation, measured by RR interval variability (RRV), is associated with risk. The relationship among these variables is unclear. Methods: We examined the cross-sectional relationship between RRV and age, race, and sex in 757 subjects from the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Disease in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. Results: Age was a significant determinant of RRV, despite the narrow range (33-47): participants aged 33-39 years had had greater levels of HF power, LF power, and standard deviation (SD) of RR intervals than did those aged 40-47 years. There was no age effect for the LF/HF ratio. Compared to whites, blacks had lower levels of LF power, SD, and lower LF/HF. Blacks and whites did not differ in HF power. Finally, compared to men, women had lower levels of LF power, SD, and LF/HF but did not differ in HF power. Conclusions: Data from the CARDIA study suggest that in adults in the 33-47 year age range, indices of RRV were greater in younger compared to older subjects, in men compared to women and in whites compared to blacks. These findings are broadly consistent with those of other large studies examining relationships between RRV and age, sex, and race. However, patterns of associations between RRV and these stratification variables are not entirely consistent with an underlying autonomic physiology linked to cardioprotection. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methods and Procedures: This prospective study examined changes in adiposity assessed via computed tomography (CT) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry among 122 premenopausal women (50 black, 72 white) examined in 1995-1996 and again in 2000-2001. During the 5-year interval, 14 women had one interim birth and 108 had no interim births. Multiple linear regression models estimated mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) 5-year changes in anthropometric and adiposity measures by interim births adjusted for age, race, and changes in total and subcutaneous adiposity. Results: We found no significant differences between one interim birth and no interim births for 5-year changes in weight, BMI, total body fat, subcutaneous adipose tissue, or total abdominal adipose tissue. Visceral adipose tissue increased by 40 and 14% above initial levels for 1 birth and 0 birth groups, respectively.

The aim of the study was to examine the extent to which neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with impaired fitness, independent of clinical characteristics and individual-level SES. Methods Two thousand five hundred five participants 25 to 42 years old examined in the CARDIA study from 1992 to 1993 underwent symptom-limited exercise stress testing. Physical fitness was considered impaired if metabolic equivalents were in the lowest sex-specific quintile. Neighborhood SES was determined for each census tract using 1990 census data. Generalized estimating equations assessed the association between neighborhood SES and physical fitness, before and after adjustments for individual SES, sociodemographic, and clinical characteristics, and accounted for clustering within census tracts. Results Individuals in disadvantaged neighborhoods had lower educational attainment and income, and were more likely unemployed, black, and uninsured. The odds ratio (95% CI) for impaired physical fitness in the lowest vs highest tertile of neighborhood SES was 5.8 (3.7-7.3). These became 3.9 (2.7-5:7) after adjusting for individuals' educational attainment, personal income, employment status, and ability to pay for basic needs; and 1.9 (1.2-2.9) after additional adjustment for other sociodemographic and clinical factors. Conclusions Features of one's neighborhood of residence are relevant to cardiovascular health. A health policy perspective that looks beyond an individual's characteristics may therefore be useful in identifying more effective interventions to reduce the prevalence of low physical fitness and its consequences in young adults.",30,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0002-8703,1097-5330,AM HEART J,Am.

We studied 2504 CARDIA participants (Blacks and Whites, 18-30 years old when recruited in 1985-86 from four US cities, reexamination 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 years later) who never reported current smoking and attended examinations at 10 or 15 years. Results. In non-smokers with a college degree (n = 1581), total passive smoke exposure declined from 16.3 h/week in 1985/86 to 2.3 h/week in 2000/01. Less education tended to be associated with more exposure at all timepoints, for example, in high school or less (n = 292) 22.2 h/week in 1985/86 to 8.5 h/week in 2000/01. Those who experienced an increase in the restrictiveness of self-reported workplace smoking policy from 1995/96 to 2000/01 were exposed to almost 3 h per week less passive smoke than those whose workplace policies became less restrictive in this time period.

We assessed whether drug use predicted decline in general self-rated health (GSRH) in a community-based cohort, healthy at baseline. Methods: A prospective cohort of 3124 young adults (20-32 years old) from four US cities, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, was followed from 1987/1988 to 2000/2001. All reported ""Good"" or better GSRH at baseline, with reassessment in 2000/2001. Drug use in 1987/1988 was as follows: 812 participants were Never Users; 1554 Past Users Only; 503 Current Marijuana Users Only; 255 Current Hard Drug Users (e.g. cocaine, amphetamines, opiates). Analyses measured the association of drug use (1987/1988) with decline to ""Fair"" or ""Poor"" GSRH in 2000/2001, adjusting for biological and psychosocial covariates. Results: Reporting health decline were: 7.2% of Never Users; 6.5%, Past Use Only; 7.0%, Current Marijuana Only; 12.6%, Current Hard Drugs (p < 0.01). After multivariable adjustment, Current Hard Drug Use in 1987/1988 remained associated with health decline (Odds Ratio (OR), referent Never Use: 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-3.12). The health decline associated with Current Hard Drugs appeared to be partly mediated by tobacco smoking in 2000/2001, which independently predicted health decline (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.08-2.50) and weakened the apparent effect of Current Hard Drugs (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.62-2.36). Conclusions: Hard drug use in healthy young adults, even when hard drug use stops; is associated with a subsequent decrease in general self-rated health that may be partially explained by persistent tobacco use.

Associations between hostility and pulmonary function in the coronary artery risk development in (Young) Adults (CARDIA) study,HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY,Article,"Objective: To examine the cross-sectional association between hostility and pulmonary function (PF) and its consistency across race/ethnicity- gender groups. Design: Data were from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in (Young) Adults (CARDIA) cohort study (N = 4,629). Participants were recruited from 4 metropolitan areas in the United States, ages 18-30 years at baseline in 1985-1986, approximately balanced across race/ethnicity (Black, White) and gender. Main Outcome Measures: Main outcome measures were percent predicted values for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV,) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Results: In full-sample multiple linear regression analyses, each 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in hostility was associated with a 0.66% decrease in FEV, (p =.0002) and a 0.60% decrease in FVC (p =.0006). This inverse association of hostility with PF remained after controlling for age, height, current socioeconomic status (SES), participant smoking status, and asthma and is more consistent than that of smoking and PF. In stratified analyses, each 1 SD increase in hostility predicted statistically significant reductions in PF for Black women, White women, and Black men. For White men, hostility showed no statistically significant relation with PF, although the pattern relating hostility to PF was similar to the pattern in the other three groups. Further, both of the post hoe three-way interaction terms for hostility, race/ethnicity, and gender predicting FEV, and FVC were nonsignificant. Conclusion: PF was inversely associated with hostility across race/ethnicity and gender, independent of age, height, current SES, smoking, and asthma.

The association between physical activity or cardiovascular fitness and chronic disease risk in men might be mediated, in part, through androgens. Limited data exists on the potential associations of activity or fitness with serum hormones. We examined the associations of serum testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations with physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness in black and white young men. Method. Data were collected from 391 black and 604 white male participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in (Young) Adults (CARDIA) Male Hormone Study aged 24-32 in 1992-1993. Cross-sectional associations of serum total testosterone (TT), bioavailable testosterone (BT) and SHBG levels with self-reported total physical activity score, and in a subset of men (n = 617) with cardiorespiratory fitness measured via duration on a treadmill test were assessed. Five-year longitudinal associations of change in hormones with changes in physical activity also were examined. Results. There were no cross-sectional or longitudinal associations of physical activity with SHBG, TT or BT in either black or white men. Fitness was positively associated with SHBG only in white men, but was not associated with TT or BT in either group. Conclusion. Overall the results do not support an association of self-reported physical activity with androgens, whereas they do suggest that fitness might be associated with SHBG in white men.

METHODS: This 3-year prospective study examined changes in metabolic risk factors among lactating women from preconception to postweaning and among nonlactating women from preconception to postdelivery, in comparison with nongravid women. Of 1,051 (490 black, 561 white) women who attended two consecutive study visits in years 7 (1992-1993) and 10 (1995-1996), 942 were nongravid and 109 had one interim birth. Of parous women, 48 (45%) did not lactate, and 61 (55%) lactated and weaned before year 10. The lactated and weaned women were subdivided by duration of lactation into less than 3 months and 3 months or more. Multiple linear regression models estimated mean 3-year changes in metabolic risk factors adjusted for age, race, parity, education, and behavioral covariates. RESULTS: Both parous women who did not lactate and parous women who lactated and weaned gained more weight (+5.6, +4.4 kg) and waist girth (+5.3, +4.9 cm) than nongravid women over the 3-year interval; P<.001. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+6.7 mg/dL, P<.05) and fasting insulin (+2.6 microunits, P=.06) increased more for parous women who did not lactate than for nongravid and parous women who lactated and weaned. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol decrements for both parous women who did not lactate and parous women who lactated and weaned were 4.0 mg/dL greater than for nongravid women (P<.001). Among parous, lactated and weaned women, lactation for 3 months or longer was associated with a smaller decrement in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-1.3 mg/dL versus -7.3 mg/dL for less than 3 months; P<.01). CONCLUSION: Lactation may attenuate unfavorable metabolic risk factor changes that occur with pregnancy, with effects apparent after weaning. As a modifiable behavior, lactation may affect women's future risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.",73,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0029-7844,,OBSTET GYNECOL,Obstet.

We analyzed the contribution of individual and pairwise combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the APOA1/APOC3 genes to HDL-C variability to evaluate (1) consistency of published single-SNP studies with our single-SNP analyses; (2) consistency of single-SNP and two-SNP phenotype-genotype relationships across race-, gender-, and geographical location-dependent contexts; and (3) the contribution of single SNPs and pairs of SNPs to variability beyond that explained by plasma apo A-I concentration. We analyzed 45 SNPs in 3,831 young Aftican-American (N = 1,858) and European-American (N = 1,973) females and males ascertained by the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. We found three SNPs that significantly impact HDL-C variability in both the literature and the CARDIA sample. Single-SNP analyses identified only one of five significant HDL-C SNP genotype relationships in the CARDIA study that was consistent across all race-, gender-, and geographical location-dependent contexts. The other four were consistent across geographical locations for a particular race-gender context. The portion of total phenotypic variance explained by single-SNP genotypes and genotypes defined by pairs of SNPs was less than 3%, an amount that is miniscule compared to the contribution explained by variability in plasma apo A-I concentration.

The coronary artery risk development in young adults (CARDIA) study,JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH,Article,"Background: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in premenopausal and postmenopausal women are differentially affected by exogenous sex hormones depending on their apolipoprotein E (apo E) genotype. Because endogenous sex hormones markedly increase during pregnancy, we examined whether HDL-C declines after a first birth varied by apo E polymorphisms. Methods: In 1147 nulliparas (416 black, 731 white), fasting blood samples (nonpregnant) were drawn at baseline and at follow-up years 5, 7, and 10. Time-dependent pregnancy groups included 0 pregnancies (P0), 1 + short pregnancy (P1+), 1 birth (B1), 2 or more births (B2+). ApoE groups by alleles identified with a phenotype method included E4 (4/3 and 4/4), E3 (3/3), and E2 (2/2 and 3/2). Differences in adjusted mean HDL-C changes among pregnancy groups and ApoE groups were examined using repeated measures multiple linear regression. Results: HDL-C declines associated with parity (one or more births) depended on ApoE group (ApoE*Pregnancy Interaction; p < 0.002). For B1 and B2+ vs. P0, HDL-C declines were - 2.4 to - 2.7 mg/dl in E4 and - 3.4 to - 4.1 mg/dl in E3. In E2, HDL-C declines were - 6.6 mg/dl for one birth, and - 11.5 mg/dl for two or more births, each relative to the 0 pregnancies ( P0) group (linear trend, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The degree to which childbearing adversely affects long-term HDL-C declines varies by apo E phenotype, based on a method that accurately classifies genotype. Our findings show that 2/2 and 3/2 genotypes are associated with larger parity-related HDL-C declines than 3/3, 4/3, and 4/4 genotypes.",2,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC,NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1540-9996,,J WOMENS HEALTH,J.

Research Methods and Procedures: A prospective, multicenter observational study, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study from 1986 to 1996, examined subjects at baseline and in follow-up years 2, 5, 7. and 10. Included were 998 (328 black and 670 white) nulliparous women, age 18-30 years, who were not overweight at baseline. Relative odds for incident overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m(2)) associated with parity change (0, 1, or 2+) and risk factors were estimated using discrete-time survival models adjusted for baseline and time-dependent covariates. Results: Parity change-association with development of overweight depended on smoking habit (interaction, p < 0.001). In multivariate adjusted models, 1 and 2+ births vs. 0, respectively, were associated with increased risk for development of overweight among never smokers [odds ratio (OR) = 2.66; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.80, 3.93, and 2.10, 95% CI: 1.24, 3.56] and decreased risk among current smokers (OR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.96, and 0.36, 95% CI: 0.08, 1.65).

Methods; We included participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, ages 18-30 years at baseline (1985-1986) and followed with eight examinations for up to 30 years. Long-term glucose variability was assessed using the CV (CV-FG) and the absolute difference between successive FG measurements (average real variability; ARV-FG). For participants who developed any event (diabetes, CVD or mortality), FG variability measurement was censored at the examination prior to event ascertainment. We estimated HRs for incident diabetes, CVD and mortality with adjustment for demographics, baseline FG, change in FG (censor - baseline) and time-varying education, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, physical activity, systolic BP, BP medications, LDL-cholesterol and cholesterol medications (and incident diabetes and diabetes medications for CVD and mortality outcomes). Results: Among 3769 black and white participants, there were 317 incident diabetes cases (102,677 person-years), 159 incident CVD events (110,314 person-years) and 174 deaths (111,390 person-years). After adjustment, HRs per 1 SD higher ARV-FG were 1.64 (95% CI 1.52, 1.78) for diabetes, 1.15 (95% CI 1.01, 1.31) for CVD and 1.25 (95% CI 1.11, 1.40) for mortality.

How and when occupational cognitive complexity first exerts protective effects during the life span remains unclear. We investigated associations between occupational cognitive complexity during early to midadulthood and brain structure and cognition in midlife. Method: Participants were 669 adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (aged 18-30 years at baseline, 52% female, 38% Black). We calculated scores reflecting occupational cognitive complexity using Census Occupation Codes (years 10 and 15) and Occupational Information Network (O*NET) data. At year 25, participants had structural brain magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and cognitive testing (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Stroop). In adjusted mixed models, we examined associations between occupational cognitive complexity during early to midadulthood and midlife brain structure, specifically gray matter volume and white matter fractional anisotropy, and cognition in midlife (all outcomes converted to z-scores). Results: Higher occupational cognitive complexity was associated with greaterwhite matter fractional anisotropy (estimate = 0.10, p = .01) but not gray matter volume.

We evaluated the association of abdominal intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) volume with coronary artery calcification in the CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) participants. Approach and Results-We measured IMAT in the abdominal muscles, visceral adipose tissue and pericardial adipose tissue, and coronary artery calcification using computed tomography in 3051 CARDIA participants (56% women) at the CARDIA year 25 examination (2010-2011). Mean IMAT volume and mean IMAT/total muscle volume (IMAT normalized for muscle size) were calculated in a 10-mm block of slices centered at L3-L4. Multivariable analyses included potential confounders and traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors. Compared with the lowest quartile, the upper quartile of abdominal IMAT volume was associated with higher coronary artery calcification prevalence (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.6 [1.2-2.1]) after adjusting for cardiovascular disease risk factors. Results were similar for highest versus lowest quartile of IMAT normalized to total muscle volume (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.5 [1.1-2.0]). Significant associations of higher IMAT and normalized IMAT with coronary artery calcification prevalence persisted when body mass index, visceral adipose tissue, or pericardial adipose tissue were added to the models.

J,"Al Hazzouri, AZ; Elfassy, T; Sidney, S; Jacobs, D; Stable, EJP; Yaffe, K",Sustained Economic Hardship and Cognitive Function: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE,Article,"Introduction: The relationship between low income and worse health outcomes is evident, yet its association with cognitive outcomes is less explored. Most studies have measured income at one time and none have examined how sustained exposure to low income influences cognition in a relatively young cohort. This study examined the effect of sustained poverty and perceived financial difficulty on cognitive function in midlife. Methods: Income data were collected six times between 1985 and 2010 for 3,383 adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults prospective cohort study. Sustained poverty was defined by the percentage of time participants' household income was <200% of the federal poverty level-""never"" in poverty, ""0< to <1/3,"" "" >= 1/3 to <100%"" or "" all-time."" In 2010, at a mean age of 50 years, participants underwent a cognitive battery. Data were analyzed in 2015. Results: In demographic-adjusted linear regression models, individuals with all-time poverty performed significantly worse than individuals never in poverty: 0.92 points worse on verbal memory (z-score, -0.28; 95% CI=-0.43, -0.13), 11.60 points worse on processing speed (z-score, -0.72; 95% CI=- 0.85, -0.58), and 3.50 points worse on executive function (z-score, -0.32; 95% CI=-0.47, -0.17). Similar results were observed with perceived financial difficulty. Findings were robust when restricted to highly educated participants, suggesting little evidence for reverse causation. Conclusions: Cumulative exposure to low income over 2 decades was strongly associated with worse cognitive function of a relatively young cohort. Poverty and perceived hardship may be important contributors to premature aging among disadvantaged populations. (C) 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesised that higher fitness levels would be associated with reduced risk for developing incident prediabetes/diabetes by middle age. Methods Participants were from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who were free from prediabetes/diabetes at baseline (year 0 [Y0]: 1985-1986). CRF was quantified by treadmill duration (converted to metabolic equivalents [METs]) at Y0, Y7 and Y20 and prediabetes/diabetes status was assessed at Y0, Y7, Y10, Y15, Y20 and Y25. We use an extended Cox model with CRF as the primary time-varying exposure. BMI was included as a time-varying covariate. The outcome was development of either prediabetes or diabetes after Y0. Model 1 included age, race, sex, field centre, CRF and BMI. Model 2 additionally included baseline (Y0) smoking, energy intake, alcohol intake, education, systolic BP, BP medication use and lipid profile. Results Higher fitness was associated with lower risk for developing incident prediabetes/diabetes (difference of 1 MET: HR 0.99898 [95% CI 0.99861, 0.99940], p < 0.01), which persisted (difference of 1 MET: HR 0.99872 [95% CI 0.99840, 0.99904], p < 0.01] when adjusting for covariates. Conclusions/interpretation Examining participants who had fitness measured from young adulthood to middle age, we found that fitness was associated with lower risk for developing prediabetes/diabetes, even when adjusting for BMI over this time period.

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to quantify the associations between apoB and the discordance between apoB and LDL-C or non-HDL-C in young adults and measured coronary artery calcium (CAC) in midlife. METHODS Data were derived from a multicenter cohort study of young adults recruited at ages 18 to 30 years. All participants with complete baseline CVD risk factor data, including apoB and year 25 (Y25) CAC score, were entered into this study. Presence of CAC was defined as having a positive, nonzero Agatston score as determined by computed tomography. Baseline apoB values were divided into tertiles of 4 mutually exclusive concordant/discordant groups, based on median apoB and LDL-C or non-HDL-C. RESULTS Analysis included 2,794 participants (mean age: 25 +/- 3.6 years; body mass index: 24.5 +/- 5 kg/m(2); and 44.4% male). Mean lipid values were as follows: total cholesterol: 177.3 +/- 33.1 mg/dl; LDL-C: 109.9 +/- 31.1 mg/dl; non-HDL-C: 124.0 +/- 33.5 mg/dl; HDL-C: 53 +/- 12.8 mg/dl; and apoB: 90.7 +/- 24 mg/dl; median triglycerides were 61 mg/dl. Compared with the lowest apoB tertile, higher odds of developing Y25 CAC were seen in the middle (odds ratio [OR]: 1.53) and high (OR: 2.28) tertiles based on traditional risk factor-adjusted models. High apoB and low LDL-C or non-HDL-C discordance was also associated with Y25 CAC in adjusted models (OR: 1.55 and OR: 1.45, respectively). CONCLUSIONS These data suggest a dose-response association between apoB in young adults and the presence of midlife CAC independent of baseline traditional CVD risk factors.

Yet, few studies have examined the effects of sedentary behavior on cognition or the long-term role of either behavior in early to middle adulthood. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between 25-year patterns of television viewing and physical activity and midlife cognition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective study of 3247 adults (black and white races; aged 18-30 years) enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study (March 25, 1985, to August 31, 2011). Data analysis was performed June 1, 2014, through April 15, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We assessed television viewing and physical activity at repeated visits (>= 3 assessments) over 25 years using a validated questionnaire. A 25-year pattern of high television viewing was defined as watching TV above the upper baseline quartile (>3 hours/d) for more than two-thirds of the visits, and a 25-year pattern of low physical activity was defined as activity levels below the lower, sex-specific baseline quartile for more than two-thirds of the of the visits. We evaluated cognitive function at year 25 using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Stroop test, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. RESULTS At baseline, the mean (SD) age of the 3247 study participants was 25.1 (3.6) years, 1836 (56.5%) were female, 1771 (54.5%) were white, and 3015 (92.9%) had completed at least high school. Compared with participants with low television viewing, those with high television viewing during 25 years (353 of 3247 [10.9%]) were more likely to have poor cognitive performance (<1 SD below the race-specific mean) on the DSST and Stroop test, with findings reported as adjusted odds ratio (95% CI): DSST, 1.64 (1.21-2.23) and Stroop test, 1.56 (1.13-2.14), but not the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, adjusted for age, race, sex, educational level, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, and hypertension. Low physical activity during 25 years in 528 of 3247 participants (16.3%) was significantly associated with poor performance on the DSST, 1.47 (1.14-1.90). Compared with participants with low television viewing and high physical activity, the odds of poor performance were almost 2 times higher for adults with both high television viewing and low physical activity in 107 of 3247 (3.3%) (DSST, 1.95 [1.19-3.22], and Stroop test, 2.20 [1.36-3.56]).

OBJECTIVE To examine whether CRF in young adults is associated with long-term clinical outcome and subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective study of 4872 US adults aged 18 to 30 years who underwent treadmill exercise testing at a baseline study visit from March 25, 1985, to June 7, 1986, and 2472 individuals who underwent a second treadmill test 7 years later. Median follow-up was 26.9 years, with assessment of obesity, left ventricular mass and strain, coronary artery calcification (CAC), and vital status and incident CVD. Follow-up was complete on August 31, 2011, and data were analyzed from recruitment through the end of follow-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The presence of CAC was assessed by computed tomography at years 15 (2000-2001), 20 (2005-2006), and 25 (2010-2011), and left ventricular mass was assessed at years 5 (1990-1991) and 25 (with global longitudinal strain). Incident CVD and all-cause mortality were adjudicated. RESULTS Of the 4872 individuals, 273 (5.6%) died and 193 (4.0%) experienced CVD events during follow-up. After comprehensive adjustment, each additional minute of baseline exercise test duration was associated with a 15% lower hazard of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.80-0.91; P <.001) and a 12% lower hazard of CVD (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.96; P =.002). Higher levels of baseline CRF were associated with significantly lower left ventricular mass index (beta = -0.24; 95% CI, -0.45 to -0.03; P =.02) and significantly better lobal longitudinal strain (beta = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.14 to -0.05; P <.001) at year 25. Fitness was not associated with CAC. A 1-minute reduction in fitness by year 7 was associated with 21% and 20% increased hazards of death (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.07-1.37; P =.002) and CVD (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06-1.37; P =.006), respectively, along with a more impaired strain (beta = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.08-0.23; P <.001). No association between change in fitness and CAC was found. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Higher levels of fitness at baseline and improvement in fitness early in adulthood are favorably associated with lower risks for CVD and mortality. Fitness and changes in fitness are associated withmyocardial hypertrophy and dysfunction but not CAC. Regular efforts to ascertain and improve CRF in young adulthood may play a critical role in promoting cardiovascular health and interrupting early CVD pathogenesis.",66,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2168-6106,2168-6114,JAMA INTERN MED,JAMA Intern.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association of a modified Mediterranean diet (mMedDiet) score with the 25-year incidence of the MetSyn in 4713 African American and white adults enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. A diet history questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake at baseline, year 7 and year 20 and a mMedDiet score was created. Cardiovascular risk factors were measured at multiple examinations over 25 years. The MetSyn was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria. Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis was use to evaluate associations for incident MetSyn across the mMedDiet score categories adjusting for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors and BMI. Higher mMedDiet scores represented adherence to a dietary pattern rich in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and fish, but poor in red and processed meat and snack foods. The incidence of MetSyn components (abdominal obesity, elevated TAG concentrations and low HDL-cholesterol concentrations) was lower in those with higher mMedDiet scores than in those with lower scores. Furthermore, the incidence of the MetSyn was lower across the five mMedDiet score categories; the hazard ratios and 95% CI from category 1 to category 5 were 1.0; 0.94 (0.76, 1.15); 0.84 (0.68, 1.04); 0.73 (0.58, 0.92); and 0.72 (0.54, 0.96), respectively (P-trend = 0.005).

Using data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), which recruited healthy young adults aged 18 to 30 years (mean age, 25 years) at baseline (Y-0), we assessed BP variability by SD and average real variability (ARV) for 25 years (8 visits). Cognitive function was assessed with the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (psychomotor speed test), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (verbal memory test), and the modified Stroop test (executive function test) at follow-up (Y-25). At the Y-25 examination, participants (n= 2326) had a mean age of 50.4 years, 43% were men, and 40% were black. In multivariable-adjusted linear regression models, higher ARV(SBP), ARV(DBP), and SDDBP were significantly associated with lower scores of Digit Symbol Substitution Test (beta[SE]: -0.025 [0.006], -0.029 [0.007], and -0.029 [0.007], respectively; all P<0.001) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (beta[SE]: -0.016 [0.006], -0.021 [0.007], and -0.019 [0.007], respectively; all P<0.05) after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics and with cumulative exposure to BP through Y-0 to Y-25.

BACKGROUND Longstanding obesity may be associated with clinical cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Whether obesity relates to cardiac dysfunction during young adulthood and middle age has not been investigated. METHODS The CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adult) study enrolled white and black adults ages 18 to 30 years in 1985 to 1986 (Year-0). At Year-25, cardiac function was assessed by conventional echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE). Twenty-five-year change in BMI (classified as low: <27 kg/m(2) and high: >= 27 kg/m(2)) was categorized into 4 groups (Low-Low, High-Low, Low-High, and High-High). Multiple linear regression was used to quantify the association between categorical changes in BMI (Low-Low as reference) with LV structural and functional parameters obtained in middle age, adjusting for baseline and 25-year change in risk factors. RESULTS The mean BMI was 24.4 kg/m(2) in 3,265 participants included at Year-0. Change in BMI adjusted for risk factors was directly associated with incipient myocardial systolic dysfunction assessed by STE (High-High: beta-coefficient = 0.67; Low-High: beta-coefficient = 0.35 for longitudinal peak systolic strain) and diastolic dysfunction assessed by TDI (High-High: beta-coefficient = -074; Low-High: beta-coefficient = -0.45 for e') and STE (High-High: beta-coefficient = -0.06 for circumferential early diastolic strain rate). Greater BMI was also significantly associated with increased LV mass/height (High-High: beta-coefficient = 26.11; Low-High: beta-coefficient = 11.87). CONCLUSIONS Longstanding obesity from young adulthood to middle age is associated with impaired LV systolic and diastolic function assessed by conventional echocardiography, TDI, and STE in a large biracial cohort of adults age 43 to 55 years.

Methods and Results-The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) prospective cohort study (n=3538) assessed 5 healthy lifestyle factors (HLFs) among young adults aged 18 to 30 years (year 0 baseline) and 20 years later (year 20): not overweight/obese, low alcohol intake, healthy diet, physically active, nonsmoker. We tested whether change from year 0 to 20 in a continuous composite HLF score (HLF change; range, -5 to +5) is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcification and carotid intima-media thickness) at year 20, after adjustment for demographics, medications, and baseline HLFs. By year 20, 25.3% of the sample improved (HLF change >=+1); 40.4% deteriorated (had fewer HLFs); 34.4% stayed the same; and 19.2% had coronary artery calcification (>0).

Data are sparse on long-term follow-up and outcomes associated with ER in younger adults. Methods and Results We prospectively examined 5039 participants (mean age, 25 years at baseline, 40% black) from the Coronary Artery Disease Risk in Adults (CARDIA) cohort for 23 years. Twelve-lead ECGs were recorded and analyzed at years 0, 7, and 20 and coded as definite or probable ER using a standardized algorithm. Cox regression was used, and models were adjusted for important baseline and clinical covariates. Kaplan-Meier curves were created for presence of ER and total mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Participants with ER were more likely to be black, male, smoke, have higher systolic blood pressure, lower heart rate and body mass index, higher exercise duration, and longer PR, QRS, and QT intervals. ER was associated with total mortality (hazard ratio, 1.77; confidence interval, 1.38-2.28; P<0.01) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 1.59; confidence interval, 1.01-2.50; P=0.04) in unadjusted analyses, but adjustment for age, sex, and race attenuated associations almost completely. Sex-race stratified analyses showed no significant associations between ER and outcome for any of the subgroups except blacks. Conclusions The presence of ER at any time point during 23 years of follow-up was not associated with adverse outcomes.

In addition, most studies rely on single assessments of CVRFs, which may not accurately reflect long-term exposure. We sought to determine the association between cumulative exposure to CVRFs from early to middle adulthood and cognitive function at midlife. Methods and Results In a prospective study of 3381 adults (age, 18-30 years at baseline) with 25 years of follow-up, we assessed cognitive function at year 25 (2010-2011) with the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Stroop Test, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test analyzed with standardized z scores. The primary predictor was 25-year cumulative exposure estimated by areas under the curve for resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting blood glucose, and total cholesterol. Higher cumulative systolic and diastolic blood pressures and fasting blood glucose were consistently associated with worse cognition on all 3 tests. These associations were significant primarily for exposures above recommended guidelines; cognitive test z scores were between 0.06 and 0.30 points less, on average, for each 1-SD increase in risk factor area under the curve after adjustment for age, race, sex, and education (P<0.05 for all). Fewer significant associations were observed for cholesterol.

Our goal was to determine the predictive ability of the FHS hypertension model in a cohort of young adults advancing into middle age and compare it with the predictive ability of prehypertension and individual components of the FHS model. We studied 4388 participants, aged 18 to 30 years without hypertension at baseline, enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, who participated in 2 consecutive examinations occurring 5 years apart between the baseline (1985-1986) and year 25 examination (2010-2011).

However, few studies have determined the consequences of long-term obesity. OBJECTIVE To examine whether the duration of overall and abdominal obesity was associated with the presence and 10-year progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC), a subclinical predictor of coronary heart disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective study of 3275 white and black adults aged 18 to 30 years at baseline in 1985-1986 who did not initially have overall obesity (body mass index [BMI] >= 30) or abdominal obesity (men: waist circumference [WC] >102 cm; women: >88 cm) in the multicenter, community-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Participants completed computed tomography scanning for the presence of CAC during the 15-, 20-, or 25-year follow-up examinations. Duration of overall and abdominal obesity was calculated using repeat measurements of BMI and WC, respectively, performed 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years after baseline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Presence of CAC was measured by computed tomography at the year 15 (2000-2001), year 20 (2005-2006), or year 25 (2010-2011) follow-up examinations. Ten-year progression of CAC (2000-2001 to 2010-2011) was defined as incident CAC in 2010-2011 or an increase in CAC score of 20 Agatston units or greater. RESULTS During follow-up, 40.4% and 41.0% developed overall and abdominal obesity, respectively. Rates of CAC per 1000 person-years were higher for those who experienced more than 20 years vs 0 years of overall obesity (16.0 vs 11.0, respectively) and abdominal obesity (16.7 vs 11.0). Approximately 25.2% and 27.7% of those with more than 20 years of overall and abdominal obesity, respectively, experienced progression of CAC vs 20.2% and 19.5% of those with 0 years. After adjustment for BMI or WC and potential confounders, the hazard ratios for CAC for each additional year of overall or abdominal obesity were 1.02 (95% CI, 1.01-1.03) and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.02-1.05), respectively. The adjusted odds ratios for CAC progression were 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01-1.06) and 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01-1.07), respectively. Associations were attenuated but largely persisted following additional adjustment for potential intermediate metabolic factors during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Longer duration of overall and abdominal obesity was associated with subclinical coronary heart disease and its progression through midlife independent of the degree of adiposity.

Healthy lifestyle factors defined at years 0, 7, and 20 included average body mass index <25 kg/m(2), no or moderate alcohol intake, higher healthy diet score, higher physical activity score, and never smoking. Mean age (25 years) and percentage of women (56%) were comparable across groups defined by number of healthy lifestyle factors. The age-, sex-, and race-adjusted prevalences of low cardiovascular disease risk profile at year 20 were 3.0%, 14.6%, 29.5%, 39.2%, and 60.7% for people with 0 or 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 healthy lifestyle factors, respectively (P for trend <0.0001). Similar graded relationships were observed for each sex-race group (all P for trend <0.0001). Conclusions-Maintaining a healthy lifestyle throughout young adulthood is strongly associated with a low cardiovascular disease risk profile in middle age. Public health and individual efforts are needed to improve the adoption and maintenance of healthy lifestyles in young adults.

We investigated the relationship of subclinical atherosclerosis with sICAM-1 concentration. METHODS: sICAM-1 concentration was assayed at year 15 of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study (black and white men and women, average age 40 years). We assessed progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) through year 20 (n = 2378), and both carotid artery stenosis (n = 2432) and intima-media thickness (IMT) at year 20 (n = 2240). RESULTS: Median sICAM-1 was 145.9 mu g/L. Among a subgroup with advanced atherosclerotic plaque (either CAC or stenosis), IMT was 0.010 (95% CI 0.003-0.017 mm) higher per SD of sICAM-1 (44 mu g/L) in a model adjusted for age, race, sex, clinic, smoking, exercise, body size, education, blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, plasma lipids, and cholesterol-lowering medication. With the same adjustment, the odds ratio (OR) for the presence of year-20 carotid artery stenosis per SD of sICAM-1 was 1.12 (95% CI 1.01-1.25, P < 0.04), whereas for occurrence of CAC progression the OR was 1.16 (1.04-1.31, P < 0.01). The associations with CAC and carotid stenosis were strongest in the top 20th of the sICAM-1 distribution. CONCLUSIONS: sICAM-1 concentration may be an early biomarker that indicates changes in the artery wall that accompany atherosclerosis, as well as the presence of advanced plaque in the coronary and carotid arteries. This finding holds in people with low total burden of atherosclerosis, decades before the development of clinical CVD.

Baseline cardiorespiratory fitness was determined from duration of a modified Balke treadmill test. A total of 98 SNPs in blacks and 89 SNPs in whites from seven candidate genes were genotyped. Participants that became hypertensive (295 blacks and 146 whites) had significantly higher blood pressure and BMI (both races), and lower fitness (blacks only) at baseline than those who remained normotensive. Markers at the peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A) and bradykinin beta 2 receptor (BDKRB2) genes were nominally associated with greater risk of hypertension, although one marker each at the BDKRB2 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase-3 (NOS3) genes were nominally associated with lower risk. The association of baseline fitness with risk of hypertension was nominally modified by genotype at markers within the angiotensin converting enzyme, angiotensinogen, BDKRB2 and NOS3 genes in blacks and the BDKRB2, endothelin-1 and PPARGC1A genes in whites. BDKRB2 rs4900318 showed nominal interactions with baseline fitness on the risk of hypertension in both races. The association of baseline BMI with risk of hypertension was nominally modified by GNB3 rs2301339 genotype in whites. None of the above associations were statistically significant after correcting for multiple testing. We found that SNPs in these candidate genes did not modify the association between baseline fitness or BMI and risk of hypertension in CARDIA participants.

Methods: We used 15 years of longitudinal data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a cohort of US young adults (aged 18-30 years at baseline) (n=5115), with linked time-varying geographic information system-derived food resource measures. Using repeated measures from 4 examination periods (n =15 854 person-examination observations) and conditional regression (conditioned on the individual), we modeled fast food consumption, diet quality, and adherence to fruit and vegetable recommendations as a function of fast food chain, supermarket, or grocery store availability (counts per population) within less than 1.00 km, 1.00 to 2.99 km, 3.00 to 4.99 km, and 5.00 to 8.05 km of respondents' homes. Models were sex stratified, controlled for individual sociodemographic characteristics and neighborhood poverty, and tested for interaction by individual-level income. Results: Fast food consumption was related to fast food availability among low-income respondents, particularly within 1.00 to 2.99 km of home among men (coefficient, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.51). Greater supermarket availability was generally unrelated to diet quality and fruit and vegetable intake, and relationships between grocery store availability and diet outcomes were mixed. Conclusion: Our findings provide some evidence for zoning restrictions on fast food restaurants within 3 km of low-income residents but suggest that increased access to food stores may require complementary or alternative strategies to promote dietary behavior change.",247,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0003-9926,1538-3679,ARCH INTERN MED,Arch.

We assessed 20-year incidence of hypertension, a cardiovascular disease risk factor, across 4 US urban areas and by race-sex. Among 3436 eligible adults 18 to 30 years of age when recruited in 1985 to 1986 in the community-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort, we examined 20-year cumulative incidence of hypertension (systolic blood pressure >= 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mm Hg or antihypertensive medication use at any examination) by site and race-sex, adjusting for baseline and time-dependent covariates with Cox regression. Twenty-year incidence, when the mean age was approximate to 45 years, was 34.5% in black men (n = 617), 37.6% in black women (n = 965), 21.4% in white men (n = 856), and 12.3% in white women (n = 998; P<0.001). Incidence was 33.6% in Birmingham, Ala, 23.4% in Chicago, Ill, 19% in Minneapolis, Minn, and 27.4% in Oakland, Calif (P<0.001). After adjustment for age, race, sex, heart rate, body mass index, smoking, family history, education, uric acid, alcohol use, physical activity, and baseline systolic blood pressure, hazard ratios (95% CI) compared with Birmingham were 0.72 (0.59 to 0.87) for Chicago, 0.60 (0.50 to 0.74) for Minneapolis, and 0.73 (0.61 to 0.87) for Oakland. Race-sex differences persisted after adjustment for site, especially for black women. From young adulthood to middle age, hypertension incidence varies significantly across urban areas. Independent of geography, blacks, especially women, are at markedly higher risk of hypertension. Hypertension incidence may contribute to geographic and racial differences in cardiovascular disease mortality, including stroke.

Objective To evaluate the relationship between habitual activity levels and changes in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference over 20 years. Design, Setting, and Participants The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is a prospective longitudinal study with 20 years of follow-up, 1985-1986 to 2005-2006. Habitual activity was defined as maintaining high, moderate, and low activity levels based on sex-specific tertiles of activity scores at baseline. Participants comprised a population-based multicenter cohort (Chicago, Illinois; Birmingham, Alabama; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, California) of 3554 men and women aged 18 to 30 years at baseline. Main Outcome Measures Average annual changes in BMI and waist circumference. Results Over 20 years, maintaining high levels of activity was associated with smaller gains in BMI and waist circumference compared with low activity levels after adjustment for race, baseline BMI, age, education, cigarette smoking status, alcohol use, and energy intake. Men maintaining high activity gained 2.6 fewer kilograms per year (+0.15 BMI units; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.18 vs +0.20 in the lower activity group; 95% CI, 0.17-0.23), and women maintaining higher activity gained 6.1 fewer kilograms per year (+0.17 BMI units; 95% CI, 0.12-0.21 vs +0.30 in the lower activity group; 95% CI, 0.25-0.34). Men maintaining high activity gained 3.1 fewer centimeters in waist circumference per year (+0.52 cm; 95% CI, 0.43-0.61 cm vs 0.67 cm in the lower activity group; 95% CI, 0.60-0.75 cm) and women maintaining higher activity gained 3.8 fewer centimeters per year (+0.49 cm; 95% CI, 0.39-0.58 cm vs 0.67 cm in the lower activity group; 95% CI, 0.60-0.75 cm).

We tested whether fitness and physical activity were independently associated with the 20-year incidence of hypertension in 4618 men and women. Hypertension was determined in participants who had systolic blood pressure >= 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mm Hg or who reported antihypertensive medication use. Fitness was estimated based on the duration of a symptom-limited graded exercise treadmill test, and physical activity was self-reported. The incidence rate of hypertension was 13.8 per 1000 person-years (n = 1022). Both baseline fitness (hazard ratio: 0.63 [95% CI: 0.56 to 0.70 per SD]; 2.9 minutes) and physical activity (hazard ratio: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.79 to 0.84 per SD]; 297 exercise units) were inversely associated with incident hypertension when included jointly in a model that also adjusted for age, sex, race, baseline smoking status, systolic blood pressure, alcohol intake, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, dietary fiber, dietary sodium, fasting glucose, and body mass index. The magnitude of association between physical activity and hypertension was strongest among participants in the high fitness (hazard ratio: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.68 to 0.94]) category, whereas the magnitude of association between fitness and hypertension was similar across tertiles of physical activity. The estimated proportion of hypertension cases that could be prevented if participants moved to a higher fitness category (ie, preventive fraction) was 34% and varied by race and sex group. Fitness and physical activity are each associated with incident hypertension, and low fitness may account for a substantial proportion of hypertension incidence.

However, the influences of the lipoprotein lipase SNPs on longitudinal changes of these lipids have not been systematically examined. Methods and Results-On the basis of data from 2045 African Americans and 2116 European Americans in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, we investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of lipids with 8 lipoprotein lipase SNPs, including the 2 that have been reported in genome-wide association studies. Plasma levels of HDL-C and triglycerides were measured at 7 examinations during 20 years of follow-up. In European Americans, rs328 (Ser447Stop), rs326, and rs13702 were significantly associated with cross-sectional interindividual variations in triglycerides and HDL-C (P<0.005) and with their longitudinal changes over time (P<0.05). The minor alleles in rs326, rs328, and rs13702 that predispose an individual to lower triglycerides and higher HDL-C levels at young adulthood further slow down the trajectory increase in triglycerides and decrease in HDL-C during 20 years of follow-up. In African Americans, these 3 SNPs were significantly associated with triglycerides, but only rs326 and rs13702 were associated with HDL-C (P<0.008). Rs328 showed a stronger association in European Americans than in African Americans, and adjustment for it did not remove all of the associations for the other SNPs. Longitudinal changes in either trait did not differ significantly by SNP genotypes in African Americans. Conclusions-Our data suggest that aging interacts with LPL gene variants to influence the longitudinal lipid variations, and there is population-related heterogeneity in the longitudinal associations.

Methods-We conducted a cross-sectional study of a cohort of whites and blacks of both genders with a mean age of 45 years. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors were determined in cohort members. Carotid IMT was measured from high-resolution B-mode ultrasound images at 3 levels: the common carotid artery, the carotid artery bulb (bulb), and the internal carotid artery. Associations with risk factors were evaluated by multivariate linear regression analyses. Results-Of 3258 who underwent carotid IMT measurements, common carotid artery, bulb, and internal carotid artery IMT were measured at all 3 separate levels in 3023 (92.7%). A large proportion of the variability of common carotid artery IMT was explained by cardiovascular risk factors (26.8%) but less so for the bulb (11.2%) and internal carotid artery (8.0%). Carotid IMT was consistently associated with age, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, and hypertension in all segments. Associations with fasting glucose and diastolic blood pressure were stronger for common carotid artery than for the other segments. Hypertension, diabetes, and current smoking had qualitatively stronger associations with bulb IMT and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with internal carotid artery IMT. Conclusion-In our cohort of relatively young white and black men and women, a greater proportion of the variability in common carotid IMT can be explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors than for the carotid artery bulb and internal carotid arteries.

J,"Heymsfield, SB; Scherzer, R; Pietrobelli, A; Lewis, CE; Grunfeld, C",Body mass index as a phenotypic expression of adiposity: quantitative contribution of muscularity in a population-based sample,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY,Article,"Objective: Although widely applied as a phenotypic expression of adiposity in population and gene-search studies, body mass index (BMI) is also acknowledged to reflect muscularity even though relevant studies directly measuring skeletal muscle (SM) mass are lacking. The current study aimed to fill this important gap by applying advanced imaging methods to test the hypothesis that, after controlling first for adiposity, SM mass is also a significant determinant of BMI in a population-based sample. Design: Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging scans were completed in Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study subjects aged 33-45 years. Physical activity (PA) levels, alcohol intake and adequacy of food intake were assessed by standardized questionnaires. Subjects: The study included 58 African-American ( AA) and 78 Caucasian ( C) men; and 63 AA and 64 C women. Measurements: Whole-body adipose tissue ( AT) and SM volumes. Results: AT was significantly predicted by not only BMI, but also PA and alcohol intake with total model R-2's of 0.68 (P<0.0001) for men and 0.89 (P<0.0001) for women. Men had more SM than AT at all levels of BMI whereas SM predominated in women at lower BMIs (C<26 kg/m(2); AA<28 kg/m(2)). In men, both AT and SM contributed a similar proportion of between-subject variation in BMI. In contrast, in women AT contributed similar to 30% more than SM to the variation in BMI. Developed allometric models indicated SM associations with AT, PA and race after adjusting for height. There was little association of age, lifestyle factors or race with BMI after controlling for both AT and SM. Conclusion: Variation in muscularity provides a mechanistic basis for the previously observed nonspecificity of BMI as a phenotypic expression of adiposity. These quantitative observations have important implications when choosing adiposity measures in population and gene-search studies.

Methods CRP and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) data were obtained in a population-based, prospective observational study, Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), during 1992-2006. Results CRP showed a significant positive association with insulin resistance, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally (5 year follow-up).

The gradient of HOMA-IR across CRP was attenuated but remained statistically significant after controlling for body fat measurements (0.06 in the highest vs lowest CRP in both cross-sectional [p value for trend=0.001] and longitudinal analyses [p value for trend=0.01]), and was little changed by further adjustment for oxidative stress markers (F-2-isoprostanes and oxidised LDL). There were consistent increments in the levels of HOMA-IR with increasing concentrations of CRP over time. In contrast, higher HOMA-IR did not predict future increases in CRP.

Methods and Results-We investigated the associations of 6 PCSK9 variants with LDL-C over 20 years in 1750 blacks and 1828 whites from the Coronary Artery Risk Development In Young Adults study. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess longitudinal differences in LDL-C levels between genotype categories. For blacks, LDL-C levels at age 18 were significantly lower (P < 0.001) among those with 3 genetic variants (L253F, C679X, and Y142X; 81.5 mg/dL) and A443T (95.5 mg/dL) compared with noncarriers (109.6 mg/dL). The difference in LDL-C levels from noncarriers tended to widen for those with the 3 variants only, by 0.24 mg/dL per year of age (P = 0.14). For whites with the R46L variant, compared with noncarriers, LDL-C levels at age 18 were significantly lower (84.4 mg/dL versus 100.9 mg/dL; P < 0.001), and the increase in LDL-C with age was similar to noncarriers. The 3 genetic variants and the A443T variant in black men were associated with lower carotid intima-media thickness and lower prevalence of coronary calcification measured at ages 38 to 50. Conclusions-Our results suggest that participants with several genetic variants of PCSK9 have persistently lower serum LDL-C levels than noncarriers from ages 18 to 50. Such long-term reduction in LDL-C levels is associated with reduced subclinical atherosclerosis burden in black men.

Our objective was to examine both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between objectively measured sleep and BP. Methods: This study is ancillary to the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort study. Blood pressure was measured in 2000 and 2001 and in 2005 and 2006. Sleep was measured twice using wrist actigraphy for 3 consecutive days between 2003 and 2005. Sleep duration and sleep maintenance (a component of sleep quality) were calculated. Analyses included 578 African Americans and whites aged 33 to 45 years at baseline. Outcome measures were systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) levels, 5-year change in BP, and incident hypertension. Results: After we excluded the patients who were taking antihypertensive medications and adjusted for age, race, and sex, shorter sleep duration and lower sleep maintenance predicted significantly higher SBP and DBP levels cross-sectionally as well as more adverse changes in SBP and DBP levels over 5 years (all P < .05). Short sleep duration also predicted significantly increased odds of incident hypertension (odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.78). Adjustment for 16 additional covariates, including snoring and daytime sleepiness, slightly attenuated the associations between sleep and BP. Sleep duration appeared to mediate the difference between African Americans and whites in DBP change over time (P = .02). Conclusion: Reduced sleep duration and consolidation predicted higher BP levels and adverse changes in BP, suggesting the need for studies to investigate whether interventions to optimize sleep may reduce BP.",226,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610-0946 USA",0003-9926,,ARCH INTERN MED,Arch.

Methods and Results - We assessed the interrelationships between 25 common SELP polymorphisms, soluble P-selectin, and atherosclerotic risk in 1222 EA and 1072 AA from the longitudinal population-based CARDIA study. Male sex, smoking, blood pressure, and metabolic status were strong cross-sectional correlates of soluble P-selectin among CARDIA subjects aged 33 to 45 years, explaining 13% of the variance. Among EAs, higher soluble P-selectin predicted carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) measured 5 years later, even after accounting for traditional risk factors. Common SELP nucleotide sequence variants explained 11% and 5% of the interindividual variation in soluble P-selectin levels in EAs and AAs, respectively. Four distinct variants contributed to P-selectin phenotype in EAs, including a polymorphism of the 5' SELP haplotype block associated with carotid IMT. Half of the phenotypic variation attributable to SELP in EAs could be explained by the Thr715Pro polymorphism, whereas Val599Leu was more strongly associated with soluble P-selectin among AAs.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-A prospective, biracial cohort was examined up to five times during 1985-2006 in the multicenter, U.S. population-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. The analysis included 2,408 women (1,226 black and 1,182 white) aged 18-30 years who were free of diabetes and had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < 126 mg/dl at baseline. Incident diabetes was diagnosed by self-report, diabetes medication use, FPG >= 126 mg/dl, and/or plasma glucose >= 200 mg/dl after a 2-h oral glucose load. Time-dependent interim birth groups were those with zero and those with one or more births with or without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), stratified by baseline parity. Complementary log-log models estimated relative hazards of incident diabetes by interim births adjusted for age, race, family history of diabetes, and baseline covariates (FPG, BMI, education, smoking, and physical activity). RESULTS-Of 193 incident diabetes cases in 42,782 person-years (4.5 cases/1,000 person-years), 84 (44%) had one or more interim births. Among nulliparas at baseline, incident rates per 1,000 person-years were 3.2 (95% CI 2.4-4.1) for those with no births, 2.9 (1.8-3.9) for one or more births without GDM, and 18.4 (10.9-25.9) for one or more births with GDM; adjusted relative hazards (95% CI) were 0.9 (0.6-1.4) for one or more births without GDM and 3.8 (2.2-6.6) for one or more births with GDM versus no births.

To clarify the effect of carotenoids on atherosclerotic risk factors, we examined the association of circulating carotenoids with inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and smoking. Methods: Black and white men and women in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, ages 18 to 30 years at recruitment (1985-1986) from 4 US cities, were investigated over 15 years. We included 2048 to 4580 participants in analyses of the sum of serum alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, zeaxanthin/lutein, and beta-cryptoxanthin concentrations and of lycopene at year 0 and at year 7. Results: The year 0 sum of 4 carotenoids was inversely associated (all P < 0.05) with year 0 leukocyte count (slope per sum carotenoid SD, -0.17); year 7 fibrinogen (slope, -0.10); year 7 and year 15 C-reactive protein (slope, -0.12 and -0.09); and year 15 F-2-isoprostanes (slope, -13.0), soluble P-selectin (slope, -0.48), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM1; slope, -5.1). Leukocyte counts and sICAM1 and F-2-isoprostane concentrations had stronger associations in smokers than in nonsmokers, and sICAM1 concentrations were higher in the highest carotenoid quartile in smokers than in the lowest carotenoid quartile in nonsmokers. Superoxide dismutase was positively associated with the sum of 4 carotenoids (slope, 0.12; P < 0.01). Lycopene was inversely associated only with sICAM1. The year 7 carotenoid associations with these markers were mostly similar to those at year 0.

Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Subjects: White and African Americans who either maintained (+/- 5 pounds; n = 488) or gained (> 5 pounds; n = 2788) weight over 15 years. Measurements: Anthropometrics and CVD risk factors were measured at baseline (1985-1986) and follow-up. Participants were classified as normal weight (body mass index (BMI) 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)) or overweight (BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)) at baseline. Multivariable models were stratified by ethnicity and weight change category. Results: Normal weight maintainers tended to have more favorable risk factors at baseline and follow-up than overweight maintainers. Size and direction of 15-year changes in risk factors were similar by weight status, except that in white normal weight maintainers changes in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (3.3 mg/dl (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4, 6.3)) and triglycerides (-14.7 mg/dl (-25.8,-3.7)) were more favorable. Weight gain was associated with unfavorable changes in risk factors. Weight gainers normal weight at baseline had less adverse changes in glucose, blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol (whites only) and triglycerides (African Americans only) than overweight gainers. However, normal weight African-American weight gainers had more adverse changes in total (3.1 mg/dl (0.2, 6.1)) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (3.4 mg/dl (0.6, 6.3)).

Methods and Results:We considered 80 SNPs within the apolipoprotein (APO) A1/C`31A41A5 gene cluster using an over-parameterized general linear model to identify SNPs whose genotype effects combine non-additively to influence plasma levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) in a consistent manner across ethnic strata. We analyzed population-based samples of unrelated 18 to 30 year old African-Americans (n = 1,858) and European-Americans (n = 1,973) ascertained without regard to health at four field centers (Birmingham, Ala.; Chicago, III.; Minneapolis, Minn. and Oakland, Calif., USA) by the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. To identify which SNP genotype effects combine non-additively we used a two-tier analysis strategy. We first required that pairs of SNPs show statistically significant non-additivity in both ethnic strata within a gender, where experiment-wise significance was evaluated using a permutation test to determine the probability of observing the number of tests significant in both ethnic strata by chance alone. Second, we required no significant evidence of heterogeneity of the relationship between the phenotype and the two SNP genotypes across ethnic strata and across field centers within each ethnic group. From this strategy we identified ten pairs of SNPs, involving thirteen SNPs, that displayed statistically significant non-additivity of SNP genotype effects on TC. Only one of these thirteen SNPs had statistically significant genotype effects that were consistent across samples. Conclusion: Our analyses suggest that ignoring the contribution of interactions between SINP genotype effects when modeling multi-SNP genotype-phenotype relationships may result in an underestimate of the contribution of genetic variation to variation in quantitative cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor traits.",34,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0001-5652,1423-0062,HUM HERED,Hum.

STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter, longitudinal observational study over 10 years. Comparison groups defined by the number of pregnancies and births during follow-up: P0 ( 0 pregnancies; nongravid), P1 ( 1+ miscarriages or abortions; 'short' pregnancies), B1 ( 1 birth), and B2 (2+ births). Mean changes in weight and WC for P1, B1 and B2 groups vs P0 were examined separately by race ( black and white), baseline parity ( nulliparous and parous) and baseline weight status ( normal weight; BMI <25 kg/m(2) and overweight; BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)). SUBJECTS: A population-based sample of 2070 women aged 18 - 30 y at baseline (1053 black subjects and 1017 white subjects) from Birmingham, Alabama, Chicago, Illinois, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Oakland, California were examined five times between 1985 - 1986 and 1995 - 1996. MEASURMENTS: Weight and WC measurements were obtained using standardized protocol at baseline and examinations at years 2, 5, 7 and 10. Sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral attributes were assessed at baseline and follow-up examinations. RESULTS: Gains in weight and WC associated with pregnancy and childbearing varied by race ( P<0.001), baseline parity (P<0.05) and overweight status (P<0.001). Among overweight nulliparas, excess gains in weight ( black subjects: 3 - 5 kg, white subjects: 5 - 6 kg) and WC ( black subjects: 3 - 4 cm, white subjects: 5 - 6 cm) were associated with 'short' pregnancies and one or more birth(s) during follow-up compared to no pregnancies (P<0.01 and 0.001). Among normal weight nulliparas, excess gains in weight ( about 1 kg) and WC ( 2 - 3 cm) were associated with follow-up birth( s) (P<0.05). Among women parous at baseline, no excess weight gains were found, but excess WC gains ( 2 - 4 cm) were associated with follow-up births. CONCLUSION: Substantial excess weight gain is associated with both short pregnancies and a first birth in women overweight prior to initiation of childbearing. Excess weight gain was not associated with higher order births. Increases in waist girth were cumulative with both first and higher order births among overweight as well as normal weight women.

Methods-Clotting factor assays were performed in 1254 participants 23 to 37 years of age (baseline) and repeated at ages 38 through 50 (follow-up). Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured at follow-up. Results-Baseline levels of procoagulants (%), mean (SD) were: FVII, 76 (18); FVIII, 102 (38); and von Willebrand factor, 108 (47). At follow-up, all had increased by 40% to 55%. After age adjustment, mean common carotid IMT increased from the lowest to the highest tertile of FVII in the total group (0.787 to 0.801; P=0.007), in whites (0.772 to 0.790; P=0.002), and in men (0.807 to 0.827; P=0.015). All associations were attenuated by multivariable adjustment. However, participants with FVII values in the highest tertile at one or both examinations, compared with those in the lowest tertile, had greater common carotid IMT after age and multivariable adjustment (0.806 versus 0.778; P<0.05). Baseline FVIII was associated with greater internal carotid IMT in the total group, in whites, and in women after age adjustment but not multivariable adjustment. No associations were seen for von Willebrand factor. Conclusions-FVII is associated with common carotid IMT in young adults, but the strength of the association is modified by other cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as body mass index. FVIII is associated with internal carotid IMT only in age-adjusted analyses, and no associations were observed for von Willebrand factor.

OBJECTIVE To determine if CAC in adults aged 32 to 46 years is associated with incident clinical CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality during 12.5 years of follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study is a prospective community-based study that recruited 5115 black and white participants aged 18 to 30 years from March 25, 1985, to June 7, 1986. The cohort has been under surveillance for 30 years, with CAC measured 15 (n = 3043), 20 (n = 3141), and 25 (n = 3189) years after recruitment. The mean follow-up period for incident events was 12.5 years, from the year 15 computed tomographic scan through August 31, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident CHD included fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome without myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or CHD death. Incident CVD included CHD, stroke, heart failure, and peripheral arterial disease. Death included all causes. The probability of developing CAC by age 32 to 56 years was estimated using clinical risk factors measured 7 years apart between ages 18 and 38 years. RESULTS At year 15 of the study among 3043 participants (mean [SD] age, 40.3 [3.6] years; 1383 men and 1660 women), 309 individuals (10.2%) had CAC, with a geometric mean Agatston score of 21.6 (interquartile range, 17.3-26.8). Participants were followed up for 12.5 years, with 57 incident CHD events and 108 incident CVD events observed. After adjusting for demographics, risk factors, and treatments, those with any CAC experienced a 5-fold increase in CHD events (hazard ratio [HR], 5.0; 95% CI, 2.8-8.7) and 3-fold increase in CVD events (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.9-4.7). Within CAC score strata of 1-19, 20-99, and 100 or more, the HRs for CHD were 2.6 (95% CI, 1.0-5.7), 5.8 (95% CI, 2.6-12.1), and 9.8 (95% CI, 4.5-20.5), respectively. A CAC score of 100 or more had an incidence of 22.4 deaths per 100 participants (HR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.5-10.0); of the 13 deaths in participants with a CAC score of 100 or more, 10 were adjudicated as CHD events. Risk factors for CVD in early adult life identified those above the median risk for developing CAC and, if applied, in a selective CAC screening strategy could reduce the number of people screened for CAC by 50% and the number imaged needed to find 1 person with CAC from 3.5 to 2.2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The presence of CAC among individuals aged between 32 and 46 years was associated with increased risk of fatal and nonfatal CHD during 12.5 years of follow-up. A CAC score of 100 or more was associated with early death. Adults younger than 50 years with any CAC, even with very low scores, identified on a computed tomographic scan are at elevated risk of clinical CHD, CVD, and death. Selective use of screening for CAC might be considered in individuals with risk factors in early adulthood to inform discussions about primary prevention.",76,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2380-6583,2380-6591,JAMA CARDIOL,JAMA Cardiol.,APR,2017,2,4,391,399,,10.1001/jamacardio.2016.5493,9,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,WOS:000401910700010,28196265,"Green Accepted, Green Published",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study contributes longitudinal evidence based on changes in walking, body mass index (BMI), and cardiometabolic risk following residential relocation. Methods: We examined 1079 participants in the CARDIA study who moved residential locations between 2000 and 2006 (ages 32-46 in 2000, 49% white/51% black, 55% female). We created a walkability index from measures of population density, street connectivity, and food and physical activity resources, measured at participants' pre- and post-move residential locations. Outcomes measured before and after the move included walking, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, insulin resistance, triglycerides, cholesterol, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and C-reactive protein. Fixed effects (FE) models were used to estimate associations between within-person change in walkability and within-person change in each outcome. These estimates were compared to those from random effects (RE) models to assess the implications of unmeasured confounding. Results: In FE models, a one-SD increase in walkability was associated with a 0.81 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure [95% CI: ( 1.55, 0.07)] and a 7.36 percent increase in C-reactive protein [95% CI: (0.60,14.57)]. Although several significant associations were observed in the RE models, Hausman tests suggested that these estimates were biased for most outcomes. RE estimates were most commonly biased away from the null or in the opposite direction of effect as the FE estimates. Conclusions: Greater walkability was associated with lower blood pressure and higher C-reactive protein in FE models, potentially reflecting competing health risks and benefits in dense, walkable environments. RE models tended to overstate or otherwise misrepresent the relationship between walkability and health.

We examined the association between neighborhood convenience stores and diet outcomes for 20 years of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. Methods. We used dietary data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study years 1985-1986, 1992-1993, and 2005-2006 (n = 3299; Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland, CA) and geographically and temporally matched neighborhood-level food resource and US Census data. We used random effects repeated measures regression to estimate associations between availability of neighborhood convenience stores with diet outcomes and whether these associations differed by individual-level income. Results. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, greater availability of neighborhood convenience stores was associated with lower diet quality (mean score = 66.3; SD= 13.0) for participants with lower individual-level income (b = -2.40; 95% CI = -3.30, -1.51); associations at higher individual-level income were weaker. We observed similar associations with whole grain consumption across time but no statistically significant associations with consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, artificially sweetened beverages, snacks, processed meats, fruits, or vegetables. Conclusions. The presence of neighborhood convenience stores may be associated with lower quality diets.

J,"Needham, BL; Epel, ES; Adler, NE; Kiefe, C",Trajectories of Change in Obesity and Symptoms of Depression: The CARDIA Study,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,Article,"Objectives. We investigated whether, over time, baseline obesity is associated with change in depressive symptoms or if baseline symptoms of depression are associated with change in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Methods. We used latent growth curve modeling to examine data from years 5, 10, 15, and 20 of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (n=4643). We assessed depressive symptomatology with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. Results. Respondents who started out with higher levels of depressive symptoms experienced a faster rate of increase in BMI (for Whites only) and waist circumference (for Blacks and Whites) over time than did those who reported fewer symptoms of depression in years. Initial BMI and waist circumference did not influence the rate of change in symptoms of depression over time. Conclusions. Depressive symptomatology likely plays a role in the development of physical health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, through its association with increases in relative weight and abdominal obesity over time.

J,"Bower, JK; Schreiner, PJ; Sternfeld, B; Lewis, CE",Black-White Differences in Hysterectomy Prevalence: The CARDIA Study,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,Article,"Objectives. We evaluated the cross-sectional association between race and hysterectomy prevalence in a population-based cohort of US women and investigated participant characteristics associated with racial differences. Methods. The cohort consisted of 1863 Black and White women in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study from 2000 to 2002 (years 15 and 16 after baseline). We used logistic regression to examine unadjusted and multivariable adjusted odds ratios. Results. Black women demonstrated greater odds of hysterectomy compared with White women (odds ratio [[OR]=3.52; 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.52, 4.90). Adjustment for age, educational attainment, perceived barriers to accessing medical care, body mass index, polycystic ovarian syndrome, tubal ligation, depressive symptoms, age at menarche, and geographic location minimally altered the association (OR=3.70; 95% CI=2.44, 5.61). In a subset of the study population, those with directly imaged fibroids, the association was minimally attenuated (OR=3.47; 95% CI=2.23, 5.40). Conclusions. In both unadjusted and multivariable adjusted models, Black women, compared with White women, had increased odds of hysterectomy that persisted despite adjustment for participant characteristics. The increased odds are possibly related to decisions to undergo hysterectomy.

No study has assessed whether the C/T and C/sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) ratios are associated with atherosclerosis in a U.S. population sample. Methods: This substudy included 367 women who had both cortisol from year 15 and testosterone and SHBG at year 16 of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, an ongoing observational cohort in the United States. Of these, intima-media thickness (IMT) was available at follow-up year 20 in 339 (n = 332 with measurement at carotid bulb), and 303 were free of prevalent coronary artery calcium (CAC) at year 15. Area under the curve (AUC) of salivary cortisol was available in 302 individuals. Ratios of AUCs of cortisol to total testosterone, free testosterone, and SHBG were categorized into tertiles. Associations with CAC and IMT were assessed by regression models adjusted for age, race, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, menopause, oral contraceptive use, diabetes, alcohol, and smoking. Results: Only the highest tertile of the AUC/free testosterone ratio was positively associated with carotid bulb IMT (beta = 0.088, P = 0.006). This tertile was also positively associated with new onset CAC between year 15 and 25 (OR 3.45, 95% CI 1.18-10.06). Tertiles of cortisol or testosterone alone were not associated with new onset CAC. Conclusion: AUC/Free testosterone ratio may be more associated with atherosclerosis in women than either indicator alone. The ratio may serve as a suitable biomarker of cortisol-linked stress.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the long-term association between VF intakes, including VF subgroups, in young adulthood and cognitive function in midlife. Methods: A biracial cohort of 3231 men and women aged 18-30 y at baseline in 1985-1986 were followed up for 25 y in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. Diet was measured at baseline, and in examination years 7 and 20. Cognitive function was assessed at examination year 25 through the use of 3 tests: the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and the Stroop test. The mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs in cognitive scores across intake categories were estimated through the use of the multivariable-adjusted general linear regression model. Results: Excluding potatoes, intake of whole vegetables was significantly associated with a better cognitive performance after adjustment for potential confounders in all 3 cognitive tests (quintile 5 compared with quintile 1-RAVLT, MD: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.64; P-trend = 0.08; DSST, MD: 2.84; 95% CI: 0.93, 4.75; P-trend < 0.01; Stroop test, MD: -2.87; 95% CI: -4.24, -1.50; P-trend < 0.01]. Similarly, intake of fruits, except fruit juices, was significantly related to a better cognitive performance (quintile 5 compared with quintile 1-DSST, MD: 2.41; 95% CI: 0.70, 4.12; P-trend = 0.03).

Design: The association between PCOS and longitudinal depression scores was investigated among 1127 black and white women participating in Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. PCOS was ascertained at baseline (ages 20 to 32) by U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, incorporating androgens and symptoms of oligomenorrhea and hirsutism. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale was repeated prospectively in 5-year intervals over 25 years. Mixed-effects models evaluated the association between depression scores and PCOS after adjustment for confounders and characterized the trajectory of scores. The impact of race was explored. Results: Eighty-three of 1127 (7.4%) participants met NIH PCOS criteria. Of these, 33 (40%) were black and 50 (60%) were white. CES-D scores were higher among women with PCOS [coefficient (coef) 2.51; 95% CI 1.49, 3.54; P < 0.01] across the lifespan.

This association is thought to be mediated by hypoperfusion; however, how smoking behavior relates to cerebral blood flow (CBF) remains unclear. Using data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort (mean age = 50; n = 522), we examined the association between smoking behavior (status, cumulative pack-years, age at smoking initiation, and years since cessation) and CBF (arterial spin labeling) in brain lobes and regions linked to dementia. We used adjusted linear regression models and tested whether associations differed between current and former-smokers. Compared to never-smokers, former-smokers had lower CBF in the parietal and occipital lobes, cuneus, precuneus, putamen, and insula; in contrast, current-smokers did not have lower CBF. The relationship between pack-years and CBF was different between current and former-smokers (p for interaction < 0.05): Among current-smokers, higher pack-years were associated with higher occipital, temporal, cuneus, putamen, insula, hippocampus, and caudate CBF; former-smokers had lower caudate CBF with increasing pack-years. Results show links between smoking and CBF at middle-age in regions implicated in cognitive and compulsive/addictive processes.

This study examines these associations in a multicenter US cohort and explores whether associations vary by education and income. Methods Longitudinal data from baseline daily cigarette smokers aged 18-30 years in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study were linked to inflation-adjusted cigarette carton prices from the Council for Community and Economic Research Cost of Living Index based on residential address at baseline and in years 7, 10, and 15 (1985-2001). Multivariable Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of first (any) smoking cessation and sustained smoking cessation (no relapse) associated with each $1 increase in time-dependent cigarette price over 15 years of follow-up. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic, health-related, and policy covariates. We assessed effect modification by education and household income. Results Among 1489 participants, a $1.00 higher cigarette carton price was associated with a 16% higher likelihood of first smoking cessation (HR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.21) and an 8% higher likelihood of sustained smoking cessation (HR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.14). Associations were strongest among participants with lower income for first cessation, and among those with higher income for sustained cessation. Associations were strongest for participants with less than a high school degree for both outcomes. Conclusions Results suggest higher cigarette prices promote smoking cessation among young to middle-aged adults, and that price sensitivity may differ by socioeconomic status. Implications Few studies have examined longitudinal associations of cigarette prices with smoking cessation, and findings are mixed on whether price sensitivity varies by education or income. In a cohort of US adult daily smokers, cigarette prices were associated with greater likelihood of both a first cessation and sustained cessation. Price associations with first cessation were stronger among low-income smokers, but associations with sustained cessation were stronger among high-income smokers. Results suggest that although higher cigarette prices may promote short-term smoking cessation among smokers at all income levels, additional supports may be needed to facilitate sustained smoking cessation among low-income smokers.",1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1462-2203,1469-994X,NICOTINE TOB RES,Nicotine Tob.

LV global function index (LVGFI) is a novel marker that incorporates LV structure in the assessment of LV cardiac performance. We evaluated the prognostic utility of LVGFI from young adulthood into middle age for incident heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in comparison to LVEF. Methods and results Included were 4107 CARDIA participants with echocardiograms in Year-5 (1990-1991). LVGFI was defined as LV stroke volume/LV global volume*100, where LV global volume was the sum of the LV mean cavity volume ((LV end-diastolic volume thorn LV end-systolic volume)/2) and myocardial volume (LV mass/density). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to predict incident HF and CVD outcomes. Mean age of participants was 29.8 +/- 3.7 years, 55% female, and 48.7% black. Higher body mass index [beta coefficient (B) = -0.11 standard error (SE) = 0.02, P<0.001], higher blood pressure (B = -0.04, SE = 0.01, P<0.01), smoking (B = -0.82, SE = 0.22, P<0.001), male sex (P<0.001), and black race (P<0.001) were associated with worse LVGFI. A total of 207 incident CVD events were observed over the course of 98 035 person-years at risk. Higher LVGFI was associated with HF, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.54-0.91), hard CVD HR = 0.83, 95% CI (0.71-0.96), and all CVD HR=0.83, 95% CI (0.72-0.96). For HF outcomes, Harrell's C-statistic for LVGFI (0.80) was greater than LVEF (0.66).

OBJECTIVE To quantify and compare lifetime risks for hypertension in white and African American men and women under the AHA/ACC 2017 and the Seventh Joint National Commission (JNC7) hypertension thresholds. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used individual-level pooled data from 3 contemporary cohorts in the Cardiovascular Lifetime Risk Pooling Project: the Framingham Offspring Study, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. These community-based cohorts included white and African American men and women with blood pressure assessment at multiple cohort examinations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cumulative lifetime risk for hypertension from ages 20 through 85 years, adjusted for competing risk of death and baseline hypertension prevalence. Incident hypertension under the AHA/ACC threshold was defined by a single-occasion blood pressure measurement of 130/80 mm Hg or more or self-reported use of antihypertensive medications. Incident hypertension under the JNC7 threshold was defined by a single-occasion blood pressure measurement of 140/90 mm Hg or more or the use of antihypertensive medications. RESULTS A total of 13 160 participants contributed 227 600 person-years of follow-up; the data set included individual-level data on 6313 participants at baseline (median age, 25 years), plus person-year data from participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities and Framingham Offspring studies who enrolled at older ages. Baseline prevalence of hypertension under the AHA/ACC 2017 threshold in participants entering the data set between 20 and 30 years of age was 30.7% in white men (n = 549 of 1790), 23.1% in African American men (n = 245 of 1063), 10.2% in white women (n = 210 of 2070), and 12.3% in African American women (n = 171 of 1390). White men had lifetime risk of hypertension of 83.8% (95% CI, 82.5%-85.0%); African American men, 86.1%(95% CI, 84.1%-88.1%); white women, 69.3%(95% CI, 67.8%-70.7%); and African American women, 85.7%(95% CI, 84.0%-87.5%). These were greater than corresponding lifetime risks under the JNC7 threshold for hypertension (white men, 60.5%[95% CI, 58.9%-62.1%]; African American men, 74.7%[95% CI, 71.9%-77.5%]; white women, 53.9%[95% CI, 52.5%-55.4%]; and African American women, 77.3%[95% CI, 75.0%-79.5%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Under the AHA/ACC 2017 blood pressure threshold for hypertension, lifetime risks for hypertension exceeded 75% for African American men and women and white men. Furthermore, prevalence of blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or more is very high in young adulthood, suggesting that efforts to prevent development of hypertension should be focused early in the life course.",3,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2380-6583,2380-6591,JAMA CARDIOL,JAMA Cardiol.,MAY,2019,4,5,455,459,,10.1001/jamacardio.2019.0529,5,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,WOS:000472161600011,30916719,Green Published,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods We studied 2,621 Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) participants; 45% were black, 57% were female, and mean age was 25 +/- 3.5 years at baseline (year 0). Mean diet scores were calculated from diet history at baseline, year 7, and year 20 (mean age 25, 32, and 45 years, respectively). Cognitive function was assessed at years 25 and 30 (mean age 50 and 55 years, respectively). Linear models were used to examine association between tertiles of diet score and change in composite cognitive function and cognitive z scores (verbal memory [Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test], processing speed [Digit Symbol Substitution Test], and executive function [Stroop Interference test]) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at year 30. Results DASH was not associated with change in cognitive performance. Higher MedDiet and APDQS scores were associated with less decline in cognitive function (MedDiet: low -0.04, middle 0.03, high 0.03, p = 0.03; APDQS: low -0.04, middle -0.00, high 0.06, p < 0.01) and Stroop Interference (MedDiet: low 0.09, middle -0.06, high -0.03; APDQS: low 0.10, middle 0.01, high -0.09, both p < 0.01).

Methods: We examined annual changes in blood pressure and lipids associated with UWL versus IWL in 576 participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who had lost weight over one of two time intervals (i.e., study years 5-7 or 7-10) and reported whether the weight loss was intentional at the end of the interval. Results: After adjusting for age, sex, race, and field center, an annual weight loss smaller than 6% resulted in small improvements in lipids that were similar regardless of intentionality. When annual weight loss was >= 6%, UWL was associated with less reduction in total cholesterol (-0.2 vs. -10.4 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-3.2 vs. -9.4 mg/dL), and triglycerides (-0.5 vs. -19.0 mg/dL) compared with IWL. Intentionality was not associated with the size of changes in blood pressure (systolic blood pressure: -2.7 vs. -2.0 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure: -2.2 vs. -1.3 mmHg) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.2 vs. 2.7 mg/dL).

Prior studies of fibroids and CVD have examined the subset of women with symptomatic fibroids who undergo hysterectomy, itself a risk factor for CVD. We aimed to study the risk of subclinical CVD, as determined by coronary artery calcification (CAC), carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), and left ventricular (LV) mass, in women with ultrasound-diagnosed uterine fibroids. Materials and Methods: Participants were 972 women from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a cohort recruited in 1985-1986. CARDIA screened black and white women aged 35-49 years by ultrasound for fibroids at 16 years of follow-up (2002-2004). Demographics and CVD risk factors were collected in 2000-2001 at 15 years of follow-up (baseline for this analysis). Women were tested at years 15, 20, and 25 for CAC, at year 20 for CIMT, and at year 25 for echocardiographic LV mass. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of CAC, CIMT, and LV mass. Results: Fifty-two percent of women had fibroids (61.7% in black, 38.3% in white women). Most CVD risk factors were more common in women with fibroids. Adjusted odds of subclinical CVD, such as elevated CIMT and elevated LV mass, were not different for women with fibroids compared with those without (CIMT odds ratio [OR]=1.03; confidence interval [95% CI] 0.7-1.5 and LV mass OR=1.14; 95% CI 0.77-1.68), when adjusted for confounders.

This study aimed to determine the association between lifetime exposure to marijuana and measures of subclinical atherosclerosis in mid-life. Design, setting and participants We used data from the US-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a cohort of black and white men and women aged 18-30 years at baseline in 1985-86, with up to seven follow-up examinations over 25 years. A total of 3498 participants in the CARDIA study were included in this study. Measurements Cumulative years of exposure to marijuana (expressed in marijuana-years', with 1 marijuana-year equivalent to 365 days of use) using repeated assessments every 2-5 years for 25 years. Abdominal artery calcium (AAC) and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores were measured by computed tomography at year 25 examination. Results Among 3117 participants with AAC and CAC measurements, 2627 (84%) reported past marijuana use and 1536 (49%) past daily tobacco smoking. Compared with tobacco smokers, 46% of whom reported 10 or more pack-years of use, only 12% of marijuana users reported 5 or more marijuana-years of use and only 6% reported having used marijuana daily. We found a significant interaction between never and ever tobacco users on the association between cumulative marijuana use and AAC (P=0.05). Among those who never smoked tobacco, cumulative marijuana-years were not associated with AAC or CAC in models adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, licit and illicit drug exposure and depression symptoms. However, among ever tobacco smokers, marijuana exposure was associated with AAC and CAC.

OBJECTIVE To assess the performance of the Healthy Heart Score (HHS), a lifestyle-based tool that estimates ASCVD events in older adults, for ASCVD events occurring before 55 years of age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study included 4893 US adults aged 18 to 30 years from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Participants underwent measurement of lifestyle factors from March 25, 1985, through June 7, 1986, and were followed up for a median of 27.1 years (interquartile range, 26.9-27.2 years). Data for this study were analyzed from February 24 through December 12, 2016. EXPOSURES The HHS includes age, smoking status, body mass index, alcohol intake, exercise, and a diet score composed of self-reported daily intake of cereal fiber, fruits and/or vegetables, nuts, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red and/or processed meats. The HHS in the CARDIA studywas calculated using sex-specific equations produced by its derivation cohorts. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The ability of the HHS to assess the 25-year risk for ASCVD (death from coronary heart disease, nonfatalmyocardial infarction, and fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke) in the total sample, in race-and sex-specific subgroups, and in those with and without clinical ASCVD risk factors at baseline. Model discrimination was assessed with the Harrell C statistic; model calibration, with Greenwood-Nam-D'Agostino statistics. RESULTS The study population of 4893 participants included 2205 men (45.1%) and 2688 women (54.9%) with a mean (SD) age at baseline of 24.8 (3.6) years; 2483 (50.7%) were black; and 427 (8.7%) had at least 1 clinical ASCVD risk factor (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes types 1 and 2). Among these participants, 64 premature ASCVD events occurred in women and 99 in men. The HHS showed moderate discrimination for ASCVD risk assessment in this diverse population of mostly healthy young adults (C statistic, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.66-0.76); it performed better in men (C statistic, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.68-0.79) than in women (C statistic, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62-0.75); in white (C statistic, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71-0.84) than in black (C statistic, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.60-0.72) participants; and in those without (C statistic, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.66-0.76) vs with (C statistic, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.55-0.73) clinical risk factors at baseline. The HHS was adequately calibrated overall and within each subgroup. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The HHS, when measured in younger persons without ASCVD risk factors, performs moderately well in assessing risk for ASCVD events by early middle age. Its reliance on self-reported, modifiable lifestyle factors makes it an attractive tool for risk assessment and counseling for early ASCVD prevention.",12,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2168-6106,2168-6114,JAMA INTERN MED,JAMA Intern.

OBJECTIVE To examine the association of changes in neighborhood-level racial residential segregation with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure over a 25-year period. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational study examined longitudinal data of 2280 black participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective investigation of adults aged 18 to 30 years who underwent baseline examinations in field centers in 4 US locations from March 25, 1985, to June 7, 1986, and then were re-examined for the next 25 years. Racial residential segregation was assessed using the Getis-Ord G(i)* statistic, a measure of SD between the neighborhood's racial composition (ie, percentage of black residents) and the surrounding area's racial composition. Segregation was categorized as high (G(i)* > 1.96), medium (G(i)* 0-1.96), and low (G(i)* < 0). Fixed-effects linear regression modeling was used to estimate the associations of within-person change in exposure to segregation and within-person change in blood pressure while tightly controlling for time-invariant confounders. Data analyses were performed between August 4, 2016, and February 9, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Within-person changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure across 6 examinations over 25 years. RESULTS Of the 2280 participants at baseline, 974 (42.7%) were men and 1306 (57.3%) were women. Of these, 1861 (81.6%) were living in a high-segregation neighborhood; 278 (12.2%), a medium-segregation neighborhood; and 141 (6.2%), a low-segregation neighborhood. Systolic blood pressure increased by a mean of 0.16 (95% CI, 0.06-0.26) mmHg with each 1-SD increase in segregation score after adjusting for interactions of time with age, sex, and field center. Of the 1861 participants (81.6%) who lived in high-segregation neighborhoods at baseline, reductions in exposure to segregation were associated with reductions in systolic blood pressure. Mean differences in systolic blood pressure were -1.33 (95% CI, -2.26 to -0.40) mmHg when comparing high-segregation with medium-segregation neighborhoods and -1.19 (95% CI, -2.08 to -0.31) mmHg when comparing high-segregation with low-segregation neighborhoods after adjustment for time and interactions of time with baseline age, sex, and field center.

OBJECTIVES To assess which BP components best determine incident CVD events in young adults and determine whether these associations vary by race and age at BP measurement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, this study assessed the longitudinal race-stratified associations between BP and cardiovascular outcomes. CARDIA is a community-based cohort that recruited black and white individuals (age range, 18-30 years) from March 26, 1985, through June 7, 1986. CARDIA followed up participants for up to 28 years, and 94% of the surviving cohort completed at least 1 telephone interview or examination from August 2009 through August 2014. EXPOSURES Blood pressures measubred at baseline (Y-0) and 15 years later (Y-15). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Composite CVD events, including coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and other vascular diseases. RESULTS A total of 4880 participants participated in the study (mean [SD] age, 24.9 [3.6] years at Y-0 and 25.0 [3.6] years at Y-15; 2223 male [45.6%] at Y-0 and 1800 [44.2%] at Y-15; 2657 female [54.4%] at Y-0 and 2277 [55.8%] at Y-0; 2473 black individuals [50.7%] at Y-0 and 1994 [48.9%] at Y-15; and 2407 white individuals [49.3%] at Y-0 and 2083 [51.1%] at Y-15). The mean SBP/DBP was 112/69 mm Hg in blacks and 109/68 mm Hg in whites at Y-0 and 117/77 mmHg in blacks and 110/72 mm Hg in whites at Y-15. During a 25-year follow-up from Y-0, 210 CVD events occurred (twice as many events in blacks [n = 140] compared with whites), of which 131 (87 in blacks) occurred after Y-15. With adjustments for covariates, results from Cox proportional hazards models, including SBP and DBP, jointly suggested that, at Y-0, SBP (hazard ratio [HR] per 1-SD increase, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.09-1.61) but not DBP (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.88-1.26) was associated with CVD risk in blacks, whereas DBP (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.21-2.50) but not SBP (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57-1.18) was associated with CVD risk in whites. At Y-15, SBP was the strongest indicator of CVD in blacks (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.25-2.16) and whites (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.02-2.69). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study questions the classic view that DBP is more able to identify future CVD events than SBP in all individuals younger than 50 years. In young adulthood, SBP in black individuals and DBP in white individuals were the most robust indicators of future CVD. In middle-age, SBP in both races identified risk of incident CVD.",18,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2380-6583,2380-6591,JAMA CARDIOL,JAMA Cardiol.,APR,2017,2,4,381,389,,10.1001/jamacardio.2016.5678,9,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,WOS:000401910700008,28199497,Green Published,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: In 3,126 black and white men and women (born in 1955-1968) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA), we used linear regression to examine the association of hostile attitudes (Cook-Medley questionnaire) and effortful coping assessed at baseline (1985-1986) to cognitive ability measured in 1987 and to a composite cognitive Z score of tests of verbal memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function ascertained in midlife (2010-2011). Results: Baseline hostility and effortful coping were prospectively associated with lower cognitive function 25 years later, controlling for age, sex, race, education, long-term exposure to depression, discrimination, negative life events, and baseline cognitive ability. Compared to the lowest quartile, those in the highest quartile of hostility performed 0.21 SD units lower (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.39, -0.02). Those in the highest quartile of effortful coping performed 0.30 SD units lower (95% CI -0.48, -0.12) compared to those in the lowest quartile. Further adjustment for cumulative exposure to cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the association with the cognitive composite Z score for hostility. Conclusions: Worse cognition in midlife was independently associated with 2 psychological characteristics measured in young adulthood.

How these associations evolve from young adulthood forward is unknown. Understanding the preclinical history of these associations could inform prevention strategies for common heart-lung conditions. Objectives: To use the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study to explore the development of heart-lung interactions. Methods: We analyzed cardiac structural and functional measurements determined by echocardiography at Year 25 of CARDIA and measures of pulmonary function over 20 years in 3,000 participants. Measurements and Main Results: Decline in PVC from peak was associated with larger left ventricular mass (beta = 6.05 g per SD of PVC decline; P < 0.0001) and greater cardiac output (beta = 0.109 L/min per SD of FVC decline; P = 0.001). Decline in FEV1/FVC ratio was associated with smaller left atrial internal dimension (beta = -0.038 cm per SD FEV1/FVC decline; P < 0.0001) and lower cardiac output (beta= -0.070 L/min per SD of FEV1/FVC decline; P = 0.03). Decline in PVC was associated with diastolic dysfunction (odds ratio, 3.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-8.36; P = 0.006). Conclusions: Patterns of loss of lung health are associated with specific cardiovascular phenotypes in middle age. Decline in FEV1/ FVC ratio is associated with underfilling of the left heart and low cardiac output.

Objectives: To examine the association between prevalent elevated depressive symptoms and incident asthma, and between prevalent asthma and incident elevated depressive symptoms in a cohort of young and middle-aged adults. Methods: We examined the longitudinal association between asthma and depressive symptoms bidirectionally in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort. First, 3,614 participants, free of asthma, were classified by elevated depressive symptoms at the CARDIA Year-5 exam (n=856 elevated vs. 2,758 not elevated; ages 23-35 yr) and followed for 20 years to incident asthma. Then, 3,016 participants, free of elevated depressive symptoms, were classified by self-reported current asthma status (n=188 prevalent vs. 2,828 not prevalent) at the CARDIA Year-5 exam and followed for 20 years until onset of elevated depressive symptoms. Measurements and Main Results: The relative hazard of incident asthma among those with elevated depressive symptoms was 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.02-1.56) after adjustment for covariates. When depressive status was modeled as the total number of reports of elevated depressive symptoms before the onset of asthma, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.15 (95% CI=1.02-1.29). The hazard of incident elevated depressive symptoms for those with asthma was no different than the hazard in those without asthma (adjusted hazard ratio=0.92; 95% CI=0.70-1.20).

Objectives: Our objective was to longitudinally compare the relative strengths of the associations of the metabolic syndrome and BMI with incident asthma in adults. Methods: We included 4,619 eligible participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort followed over 25 years. Incident asthma was defined by a new self-reported provider asthma diagnosis plus either the presence of asthma symptoms and/or use of asthma medications. Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed. Measurements and Main Results: Six hundred two subjects (417 women and 185 men) developed incident asthma over 25 years of follow-up. Metabolic syndrome predicted incident asthma among women but not men (unadjusted hazard ratios, 1.50 and 0.98; P = 0.01 and 0.93, respectively).

The association of metabolic syndrome with incident asthma in women was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for BMI (P = 0.44). In contrast, the association of BMI with incident asthma in women remained statistically significant after adjusting for the metabolic syndrome (P = 0.01). In a stepwise model, BMI was a stronger predictor than the metabolic syndrome (P = 0.001). Conclusions: BMI is a stronger predictor of incident asthma among women than the metabolic syndrome.

We sought to determine the independent association of housing instability in early adulthood (year 5, 1990-1991) and incident hypertension over the subsequent 15 years of follow-up (years 7, 10, 15, and 20) in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (N = 5,115). Because causes of inadequate housing and its effects on health are thought to vary by race and sex, we hypothesized that housing instability would exert a differential effect on incident hypertension by race and sex. At year 5, all CARDIA participants were asked about housing and those free of hypertension were analyzed (N = 4,342). We defined housing instability as living in overcrowded housing, moving frequently, or living doubled up. Of the 4,342 participants, 8.5 % were living in unstable housing. Across all participants, housing instability was not associated with incident hypertension (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.1; 95 % CI, 0.9-1.5) after adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, substance use, social factors, body mass index, and study site. However, the association varied by race and sex (p value for interaction, < 0.001).

There was no association among white men, black women, or black men. These findings suggest that housing instability may be a more important risk factor among white women, and may act independently or as a marker for other psychosocial stressors (e.g., stress from intimate partner violence) leading to development of hypertension.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether metabolic risk in young adults is associated with 20-year PA or fitness trajectories. Methods: Young adults were from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, baseline ages 18-30 years (n = 4161). PA was determined from a self-reported questionnaire administered at baseline and at follow-up exams at years 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20. Fitness (seconds) was estimated from a graded exercise treadmill test at baseline and years 7 and 20. Baseline metabolic risk was calculated using age-adjusted principal components analysis (elevated = top 10% of first factor), for each sex-race group, from mean arterial pressure, glucose, waist circumference, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Repeated measures general linear modeling estimated PA and fitness trajectories over 20 years, separately in sex-race groups, adjusting for age and smoking status. Results: PA was significantly lower among those with elevated metabolic risk compared with normal risk at baseline and each subsequent time point (black and white men, white women; all P < 0.0001; black women P = 0.27). Significant and consistent results were also found with fitness trajectories for all sex-race groups (P < 0.0001).

However, it is not known if serum adiponectin predicts future development of asthma or if asthma affects subsequent serum adiponectin concentrations among women. Objectives: To determine longitudinal association between serum adiponectin and incident asthma among women. Methods: We used data from examinations at Years 10, 15, and 20 of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort. In our primary analysis, the association of CARDIA Year 15 serum adiponectin concentration with Year 20 incident asthma was evaluated. In our secondary analysis, the converse direction, that is, the association of CARDIA Year 10 prevalent asthma with Year 15 serum adiponectin, was evaluated, using logistic regression techniques. Measurements and Main Results: Our primary analysis included 1,450 women, mostly premenopausal. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that the lowest tertile of Year 15 serum adiponectin concentration (<7 mg/L) predicted significantly higher risk for incident asthma at Year 20 among women (odds ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.05, 4.10), and particularly among current smokers (interaction P = 0.051). Further, low serum adiponectin was more important than body mass index in predicting the risk for incident asthma among women. We also showed that the converse relationship was not true; that is, Year 10 prevalent asthma did not predict Year 15 serum adiponectin concentrations in women. Conclusions: Serum adiponectin affects future risk for asthma in women and not vice versa. Measures that raise systemic adiponectin concentrations may lead to newer ways to prevent asthma among women, particularly among those who smoke.",38,AMER THORACIC SOC,NEW YORK,"25 BROADWAY, 18 FL, NEW YORK, NY 10004 USA",1073-449X,1535-4970,AM J RESP CRIT CARE,Am.

We examined the association of PCOS and its components with socioeconomic status (SES) over the life course to explore the role of the environment on the development of PCOS. Methods: Participants included 1163 women, aged 34-39, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Women's Study, examined at year 16 of the CARDIA study (2001). PCOS was defined according to the 1990 National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria. Results: Logistic regression models, adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and oral contraceptive (OC) use, demonstrated a statistically significant association between those women with low parental education/high personal education and PCOS (odds ratio [OR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-4.4). Conclusions: Our results indicate that women who experienced low childhood SES are at increased risk of PCOS, but this risk is limited to those who have personally attained a high level of education. More research is needed to determine the childhood socioeconomic factors that might influence this risk and whether conditions associated with upward life mobility play a role or if this group of at-risk women is simply more likely to recall the symptoms that define PCOS.",15,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1540-9996,1931-843X,J WOMENS HEALTH,J.

J,"Sloan, FA; Malone, PS; Kertesz, SG; Wang, Y; Costanzo, PR",Racial Differences in the Relationship Between Alcohol Consumption in Early Adulthood and Occupational Attainment at Midlife,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,Article,"Objectives. We assessed the relationship between alcohol consumption in young adulthood (ages 18-30 years) and occupational success 15 years later among Blacks and Whites. Methods. We analyzed data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study on employment status and occupational prestige at year 15 from baseline. The primary predictor was weekly alcohol use at baseline, after stratification by race and adjustment for socioeconomic factors. Results. We detected racial differences in the relationship between alcohol use in early adulthood and employment status at midlife. Blacks who were very heavy drinkers at baseline were more than 4 times as likely as Blacks who were occasional drinkers to be unemployed at year 15 (odds ratio [OR) = 4.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.22, 8.47). We found no statistically significant relationship among Whites. Occupational prestige at midlife was negatively related to very heavy drinking, but after adjustment for marital status, active coping, life stress, and educational attainment, this relationship was statistically significant only among Blacks. Conclusions. Heavy drinking during young adulthood was negatively associated with labor market success at midlife, especially among Blacks.

This study evaluated the hypothesis that systemic oxidant stress explains this association. Methods: This cross-sectional study used year-20 follow-up evaluation data of 2,865 eligible participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort. Current asthma was self-reported. Oxidant stress primarily was assessed by, plasma F2-isoprostane concentrations. Obesity measures included categories of BMI and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-assessed fat mass index (FMI) and lean mass index (LMI). Logistic and linear regressions were used for analyses. Results: Asthma was associated with higher plasma F2-isoprostane concentrations (p = 0.049); however, this association was not significant when adjusted for either gender or BMI. The BMI-asthma association was seen only among women (p = 0.03; gender-specific interaction, p = 0.01), and this association was not explained by plasma F2-isoprostane levels. Similarly, both FMI and LMI were positively associated with asthma in women (p = 0.20 and 0.01, respectively). These associations also were not explained by, plasma F2-isoprostane levels. Similar results were obtained when plasma levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein were used instead of F2-isoprostane levels to study the BMI-asthma association at the year-15 evaluation. Conclusions: Systemic oxidant stress, primarily assessed by plasma F2-isoprostane concentrations,was not independently associated with asthma and, therefore, may not explain the obesity-asthma association in women. The asthma-oxidant stress association is confounded by gender and obesity. This study is limited by the inability to measure airway oxidant stress. it is possible that mother (as vet undetermined) measure of systemic oxidant stress may be more relevant in asthma.

Adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and P-selectin, figure importantly in initiating the inflammatory, response. We studied the association between ICAM-1 and P-selectin concentrations and lung function in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. Methods: Spirometry testing was conducted at years 5, 10, and 20. ICAM-1 and P-selectin were assayed at year 15. Results: Complete data were obtained from 2,455 participants. We first predicted year-20 lung function from year-15 ICAM-1 concentration data. After controlling for race, gender, height, age, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol intake, BMI, and asthma status, all taken at year 15, the year-20 FVC was 164 mL higher (p < 0.0001) and FEV1 wits 115 mL higher (p = 0.0003) in the lowest ICAM-1 concentration quartile than the highest ICAM-1 quai-tile, whereas the FEV1/FVC ratio showed no association (p = 0.25). We then predicted the year-15 ICAM-1 concentration front year-5 lung function and change in lung function (year 10 - year 5). The year-15 ICAM-1 concentration was about 13 ng/mL higher in the lowest vs highest quartile of either the year-5 FVC (p = 0.01) or year-5 FEV1 (p = 0.005). Year-15 ICAM-1 concentration was unrelated to year-5 FEV1/FVC ratio. Greater loss in FVC and FEV1 (year 10 - year 5) also was associated with higher year-15 ICAM-1 concentrations. Associations between P-selectin and lung function followed a similar but weaker pattern to that observed for ICAM-1. Conclusions: These data suggest a bidirectional association between circulating adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 and P-selectin, and pattern of lung function change in adults.

The physiologic and clinical correlates of AR and MR in a free-living young adult population, however, have not, been well defined. The prevalence and correlates of AR and MR were investigated in Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), a multicenter National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute study of 4,352 men and women aged 21 to 35 years who had 2-dimensionally directed M-mode echocardiographic and spectral and color Doppler examinations. Isolated MR by color Doppler was detected in 10.4% (90.4% with trivial or mild severity). Isolated AR by color Doppler was present in 0.8% (37.7% with mild severity). Combined AR and MR occurred in 0.5%. There was no association between body mass index and the prevalence or severity of MR or AR. Left ventricular mass was greater in subjects with isolated AR (mean +/- SD 172 +/- 49 g) than in those with MR (155 +/- 48 g) and greater in both groups than in subjects without MR and AR (148 +/- 44 g). AR was associated with increased aortic root diameter, whereas subjects with isolated MR and those with AR and MR had increased left atrial dimensions and greater left ventricular internal dimensions. In conclusion, MR and AR detected by color Doppler echocardiography are relatively uncommon in a healthy young adult population, but both are associated with evidence of increased left ventricular dimensions and mass.

We assessed self-reported mental and physical health status and depressive symptoms at the Year 15 (2000-2001) follow-up examination using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-12) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Skin color was measured at the Year 7 examination (1992-1993). To assess racial discrimination, we used a summary score (range 0-21) for 7 questions on experiencing racial discrimination: at school, getting a job, getting housing, at work, at home, getting medical care, on the street or in a public setting. Self-reported racial discrimination was more common in men than in women (78.1 % versus 73.0%, p < 0.05) and in those with higher educational attainment, independent of gender. Discrimination was statistically significantly associated with worse physical and mental health in both men and women, before and after adjustment for age, education, income, and skin color. For example, mental health (0-100 scale) decreased an average of 0.29 units per unit increase in racial discrimination score in men; this became 0.32 units after adjustment. There was no association between self-reported physical and mental health and skin color.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied 3,307 CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) Study participants (age range 18-30 years and enrolled in 1985-1986) at baseline and calculated two measures of long-term glucose variability: the coefficient of variation about the mean FG (CV-FG) and the absolute difference between successive FG measurements (average real variability [ARV-FG]) before the onset of diabetes over 25 and 30 years of follow-up. Cognitive function was assessed at years 25 (2010-2011) and 30 (2015-2016) with the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Stroop Test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and category and letter fluency tests. We estimated the association between glucose variability and cognitive function test score with adjustment for clinical and behavioral risk factors, mean FG level, change in FG level, and diabetes development, medication use, and duration.

OBJECTIVE To assess whether young adults who developed hypertension, defined by the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) BP guideline, before age 40 years have higher risk for CVD events compared with those who maintained normal BP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Analyses were conducted in the prospective cohort Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, started in March 1985. CARDIA enrolled 5115 African American and white participants aged 18 to 30 years from 4 US field centers (Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, California). Outcomes were available through August 2015. EXPOSURES Using the highest BP measured from the first examination to the examination closest to, but not after, age 40 years, each participant was categorized as having normal BP (untreated systolic BP[SBP]<120 mm Hg and diastolic BP[DBP]<80 mm Hg; n = 2574); elevated BP(untreated SBP 120-129 mm Hg and DBP<80 mm Hg; n = 445); stage 1 hypertension (untreated SBP 130-139 mm Hg or DBP 80-89 mm Hg; n = 1194); or stage 2 hypertension (SBP >= 140 mm Hg, DBP >= 90 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medication; n = 638). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES CVD events: fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intervention for peripheral artery disease (PAD). RESULTS The final cohort included 4851 adults (mean age when follow-up for outcomes began, 35.7 years [SD, 3.6]; 2657 women [55%]; 2441 African American [50%]; 206 taking antihypertensive medication [4%]). Over a median follow-up of 18.8 years, 228 incident CVD events occurred (CHD, 109; stroke, 63; heart failure, 48; PAD, 8). CVD incidence rates for normal BP, elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension were 1.37 (95% CI, 1.07-1.75), 2.74 (95% CI, 1.78-4.20), 3.15 (95% CI, 2.47-4.02), and 8.04 (95% CI, 6.45-10.03) per 1000 person-years, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, hazard ratios for CVD events for elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension vs normal BP were 1.67 (95% CI, 1.01-2.77), 1.75 (95% CI, 1.22-2.53), and 3.49 (95% CI, 2.42-5.05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among young adults, those with elevated blood pressure, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension before age 40 years, as defined by the blood pressure classification in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, had significantly higher risk for subsequent cardiovascular disease events compared with those with normal blood pressure before age 40 years.

This large-scale study investigated longitudinal relationships between MetS, its components, and cellular aging markers: leukocyte mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) and telomere length (TL). Methods: We included 989 participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. MtDNAcn [study year (Y) 15, Y25] and TL (Y15, Y20, Y25) were measured via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. MetS components [waist circumference, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and fasting glucose] were determined (Y15, Y20, Y25). Generalized estimated equation and linear regression models, adjusting for sociodemographics and lifestyle, were used to examine associations between MetS and cellular aging at all time points, baseline MetS and 10-year changes in cellular aging, baseline cellular aging and 10-year changes in MetS, and 10-year changes in MetS and 10-year changes in cellular aging. Results: MtDNAcn and TL were negatively associated with age [mtDNAcn unstandardized b (B) = -4.76; P < 0.001; TL B = -51.53; P < 0.001] and positively correlated (r = 0.152; P < 0.001). High triglycerides were associated with low mtDNAcn and low HDL cholesterol with short TL.

The 10-year increase in waist circumference was associated with 10-year telomere attrition (B = -27.61; P = 0.04).

Prior studies have identified differences in traditional risk factors that may be associated with racial disparities in diabetes incidence but have not simultaneously adjusted for risk factors measured across multiple domains (eg, the individual and the environment) and updated over time. OBJECTIVE To determine the relative associations of modifiable biological, neighborhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors in young adulthood with the observed racial disparity in diabetes incidence between middle-aged black and white individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Black and white men and women from the observational Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, aged 18 to 30 years, without diabetes at baseline (1985-1986; N = 4251) were observed through 2015-2016. Sex-stratified multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling, with adjustment for time-updated covariates, was used to estimate risk for incident diabetes. Percent reduction in the beta coefficient (the logarithm used to calculate the hazard ratio [HR]) was calculated to compare black to white participants. EXPOSURES Self-identified race and factors including biological (eg, fasting glucose, body mass index), neighborhood (racial segregation and tract-level poverty), psychosocial (depressive symptoms), socioeconomic (eg, personal and parental educational attainment, current employment), and behavioral (eg, regular alcohol consumption, smoking) domains. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. RESULTS The mean (SD) age at baselinewas 25 (3.6) years, 49%(n = 2066) of the sample was black, and 54%(n = 2304) were women. Over a mean follow-up of 24.5 years, 504 cases of incident diabetes were identified. Using sex-stratified multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, black women and men were more likely to develop diabetes than white men and women (blackwomen: HR, 2.86 [95% CI, 2.19-3.72] and risk difference [RD], 89 cases/1000 people [95% CI, 61-117]; black men: HR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.28-2.17] and RD, 47 cases/1000 people [95% CI, 15-78]) after adjustment for age and center. Biological factors were most strongly associated with the disparity in diabetes risk between black and white individuals for women (percent reduction in beta, 112%) and men (percent reduction in beta, 86%). There was no longer disparity in diabetes risk between black and white middle-aged adults after adjustment for biological, neighborhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors measured over time (HR for women, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.55-1.14]; HR for men, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.62-1.38]).

Methods: In a prospective cohort of 613 black and white adults (mean age = 45.4 years) enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, participants reported typical sleep duration, dichotomized into moderate sleep duration (> 6 to <= 8 h) and short sleep duration (<= 6 h) at baseline (2005-2006). Five years later, we obtained brain MRI markers of white matter including fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and white matter hyperintensities. Results: Compared to moderate sleepers, short sleepers had an elevated ratio of white matter hyperintensities to normal tissue in the parietal region (OR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.47, 3.61) adjusted for age, race/sex, education, hypertension, stroke/TIA, depression, smoking status, and physical activity. White matter diffusivity was also higher, approximately a 0.2 standard deviation difference, in frontal, parietal, and temporal white matter regions, among those reporting shorter sleep duration in (P < 0.05 for all).

However, existing models for predicting diabetes risk were developed prior to the widespread adoption of A1C. Thus, it remains unknown how well existing diabetes risk prediction models predict incident diabetes defined according to the ADA 2010 guidelines. Accordingly, we examined the performance of an existing diabetes prediction model applied to a cohort of African American ( AA) and white adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development Study in Young Adults ( CARDIA). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We evaluated the performance of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ( ARIC) diabetes risk prediction model among 2,456 participants in CARDIA free of diabetes at the 2005-2006 exam and followed for 5 years. We evaluated model discrimination, calibration, and integrated discrimination improvement with incident diabetes defined by ADA 2010 guidelines before and after adding baseline A1C to the prediction model. RESULTS In the overall cohort, re-estimating the ARIC model in the CARDIA cohort resulted in good discrimination for the prediction of 5-year diabetes risk ( area under the curve [ AUC] 0.841). Adding baseline A1C as a predictor improved discrimination ( AUC 0.841 vs. 0.863, P = 0.03). In race-stratified analyses, model discrimination was significantly higher in whites than AA ( AUC AA 0.816 vs. whites 0.902; P = 0.008).

Metabolic variables (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, 2-h postchallenge glucose, HOMA of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], and HbA(1c)) and outcomes (impaired fasting glucose [IFG], impaired glucose tolerance [IGT], prediabetes by HbA(1c), and diabetes) were assessed concurrently and 5 years later.RESULTSAverage ST was 8.1 +/- 1.7 h/day or 55 +/- 10% of wear time. Each additional hour per day of ST was cross-sectionally associated with a 3% higher fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (both P < 0.01) but not 5-year changes in metabolic parameters. Having 10 h/day vs. <6 h/day of ST was associated with an odds ratio (OR) = 2.74 (95% CI 1.13, 6.62) for IGT and an OR = 3.80 (95% CI 1.39, 10.35) for diabetes. ST was not associated with prevalent IFG, prevalent prediabetes by HbA(1c), or 5-year incidence of any metabolic outcomes (all P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONSST was independently related to insulin, HOMA-IR, and prevalent diabetes and IGT but did not predict 5-year changes in metabolic parameters or incidence of metabolic outcomes. These results suggest that higher ST may not be a risk factor for future metabolic outcomes, but more research with repeated ST measurement and longer follow-up is needed.",24,AMER DIABETES ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"1701 N BEAUREGARD ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22311-1717 USA",0149-5992,1935-5548,DIABETES CARE,Diabetes Care,OCT,2015,38,10,1835,1843,,10.2337/dc15-0226,9,Endocrinology & Metabolism,Endocrinology & Metabolism,WOS:000361840500018,26156528,"Green Published, Bronze",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the relationship between nocturnal BP in young adults and cognitive function in midlife remains unclear. METHODS We used data from the ambulatory BP monitoring substudy of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, including 224 participants (mean age 30 years, 45% men, 63% African Americans). At the 20-year follow-up, the Stroop test (executive function), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (psychomotor speed), and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (verbal memory) were assessed. RESULTS Baseline mean office, daytime, and nocturnal BP were 109/73, 120/74, and 107/59 mm Hg, respectively. Nocturnal BP dipping, calculated as (nocturnal systolic BP [SBP]-daytime SBP) x 100/daytime SBP, was divided into quartiles (Q1: -39.3% to -16.9%; Q2: -16.8% to -13.2%, Q3 [reference]: -13.1% to -7.8%, and Q4: -7.7% to + 56.4%). In multiple regression analyses, the least nocturnal SBP dipping (Q4 vs. reference) and higher nocturnal diastolic BP level were associated with worse Stroop scores, with adjustments for demographic and clinical characteristics, and cumulative exposure to office BP during follow-up (beta [standard error]: 0.37 [0.18] and 0.19 [0.07], respectively; all P < 0.05). Digit Symbol Substitution Test and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test were not significantly associated with nocturnal SBP dipping or nocturnal SBP/diastolic BP levels. CONCLUSIONS Among healthy young adults, less nocturnal SBP dipping and higher nocturnal diastolic BP levels were associated with lower executive function in midlife, independent of multiple measures of office BP during long-term follow-up.",8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0895-7061,1941-7225,AM J HYPERTENS,Am.

Methods and results We included white and black CARDIA participants who had echocardiograms in Year-5 examination (1990-91). The combined endpoint after 20 years was incident fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular disease: myocardial infarction, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and atrial fibrillation/flutter. Echocardiography-derived M-mode LA diameter (LAD; n = 4082; 149 events) and 2D four-chamber LA area (LAA; n = 2412; 77 events) were then indexed by height or body surface area (BSA). We used Cox regression, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), and net reclassification improvement (NRI) to assess the prediction power of LA size when added to calculated FRS or FRS covariates. The LAD and LAA cohorts had similar characteristics; mean LAD/height was 2.1 +/- 0.3 mm/m and LAA/height 9.3 +/- 2.0 mm(2)/m. After indexing by height and adjusting for FRS covariates, hazard ratios were 1.31 (95% CI 1.12, 1.60) and 1.43 (95% CI 1.13, 1.80) for LAD and LAA, respectively; AUC was 0.77 for LAD and 0.78 for LAA. When LAD and LAA were indexed to BSA, the results were similar but slightly inferior. Both LAD and LAA showed modest reclassification ability, with non-significant NRIs. Conclusion LA size measurements independently predict clinical outcomes. However, it only improves discrimination over clinical parameters modestly without altering risk classification. Indexing LA size by height is at least as robust as by BSA.

Design and Setting: Longitudinal data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Sleep Study (2003-05), an observational cohort at the Chicago site. Participants: There were 503 black and white adults, ages 32-51 years, with no prior history of cardiovascular disease. Interventions: N/A. Measurement and Results: Sleep duration and fragmentation were measured using 6 days of wrist actigraphy. Sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The outcome variables, measured at 3 examinations over 10 years (Baseline [2000-01], 5-year [2005-06], and 10-year follow-up [2010-11]), were total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), and TC/HDL ratio. The associations between each sleep parameter and 10-year change in lipids were analyzed with generalized estimating equation models adjusting for relevant confounders. After adjustment, each hour increase in sleep duration was significantly associated with higher TC (5.2 mg/dL, 95%CI: 1.7, 8.6) and LDL (3.4 mg/dL, 95%CI: 0.2, 6.6) in the total sample, a 1.1 mg/dL increase in TG (95%CI: 1.0, 1.1) among men, and a borderline significant greater odds for a TC/HDL ratio >= 5 among men (OR: 1.37, 95%CI: 0.99, 1.90). Overall, sleep fragmentation and sleep quality scores were not associated with change in lipids.

Less clear is how this ""toxic"" stress becomes embedded to influence health decades later, and whether protective factors guard against these effects. Early biological embedding is hypothesized to occur through programming of the neural circuitry that influences physiological response patterns to subsequent stress, causing wear and tear across multiple regulatory systems. To examine this hypothesis, we related reports of childhood abuse to a comprehensive 18-biomarker measure of multisystem risk and also examined whether presence of a loving parental figure buffers against the impact of childhood abuse on adult risk. A total of 756 subjects (45.8% white, 42.7% male) participated in this ancillary substudy of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. Childhood stress was determined by using the Risky Families Questionnaire, a well-validated retrospective self-report scale. Linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, race, parental education, and oral contraceptive use found a significant positive relationship between reports of childhood abuse and multisystem health risks [B (SE) = 0.68 (0.16); P < 0.001]. Inversely, higher amounts of reported parental warmth and affection during childhood was associated with lower multisystem health risks [B (SE) = -0.40 (0.14); P < 0.005].

Objective: We tested whether the following BBMs were cross-sectionally associated with BMD among young adults: serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(1,25(OH)(2)D), 25-hydroxyvitamin D(25OHD), PTH, osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and urinary pyridinoline/urinary creatinine. Setting and Participants: We studied 319 individuals (134 women, 149 black, 24-36 years) recruited during 1992 through 1993 in Oakland, California. BMD was assessed with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Linear regression models estimated the association between BMD and each BBM. Results: 1,25(OH)(2)D was inversely associated with all BMDs. 25OHD was positively, and PTH inversely, associated with lumbar spine, total hip, and whole-body BMD. BAP was inversely associated with left arm, right arm, and whole-body BMD but not with spine or hip BMD. Neither osteocalcin nor urinary pyridinoline/urinary creatinine was associated with BMD. When we placed all BBMs (including 1,25(OH)(2)D) in one model, the pattern and magnitude of association was similar except for PTH, which was attenuated. The association of BMD and BBMs did not differ significantly by race or sex. Conclusions: In this cross-sectional study of healthy young men and women who had PTH levels considered normal in clinical practice, higher PTH was associated with lower BMD, particularly in weight-bearing sites (ie, spine and hip). The inverse association of 1,25(OH)(2)D, together with the attenuation of PTH, suggests that the observed association of PTH is mediated by 1,25(OH)(2)D. BAP was inversely associated with arm BMD.

Objective: The objective was to prospectively investigate the association between LC omega 3PUFAs and fish intake and incidence of asthma among American young adults. Design: A 20-y follow-up longitudinal analysis was conducted in a biracial cohort of 4162 Americans, aged 18-30 y, with a history of asthma at baseline in 1985. Diet was assessed by a validated interviewer-administered quantitative food-frequency questionnaire at the examinations in 1985, 1992, and 2005. Incident self-reported asthma was defined as having a physician diagnosis of asthma and/or the use of asthma medications between 1985 and 2005. Results: During the 20-y follow-up, 446 incident cases of asthma were identified. LC omega 3PUFA intake was significantly inversely associated with incidence of asthma after adjustment for sociodemographic, major lifestyle, and dietary confounders. The multivariable-adjusted HR for the highest quintile of LC omega 3PUFA intake as compared with the lowest, quintile was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.64; P-trend < 0.01). However, a higher frequency of nonfried fish consumption was not significantly associated with the risk of asthma. DHA showed a greater inverse association than did EPA. The association between LC omega 3PUFAs and incident asthma was not appreciably modified by sex, race, BMI, smoking status, or atopic status. Conclusion: This study showed that intakes of LC omega 3PUFAs are inversely longitudinally associated with the incidence of asthma in American young adults.

Methods: We investigated the association of PCOS and echocardiographic parameters in 984 black and white women in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a cohort followed prospectively for 20 yr. Women ages 34-46 (Year 16) completed questionnaires recalling symptoms of oligomenorrhea and hirsutism in their 20s and 30s. Serum androgens were obtained at Year 2. Women in their 20s and 30s were classified into four mutually exclusive groups: 1) PCOS; 2) isolated oligomenorrhea (IO); 3) isolated hyperandrogenism (IH); and 4) reference group. Outcome measures were defined as echocardiography data from Year 5. We used multivariable linear regression models to evaluate the association of PCOS and its components with left ventricular (LV) mass index, left atrial (LA) diameter, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), and mitral inflow early wave to late wave ratio. Results: Among 984 participants, 42 women (4.3%) were classified as PCOS, 67 (6.8%) as IO, and 178 (18.0%) as IH. In multivariable linear regression analyses, women with PCOS had a 3.14 g/m(2.7) (95% confidence interval, 0.48-5.81) higher LV mass index compared to the reference group (approximately 10% higher). PCOS women also had a 0.11 cm/m (95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.19) larger LA diameter, after adjustment for age and race. Conclusion: PCOS, but not IO or IH, is associated with a higher LV mass index and larger LA diameter in young women, suggestive of early adverse cardiac remodeling. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate whether this difference persists over time.

Objective: We evaluated associations of dietary and supplemental vitamin D intake with the 20-y incidence of metabolic syndrome. Design: Data from 4727 black and white young men and women from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study were used to examine relations of dietary plus supplemental vitamin D intake with the incidence of metabolic syndrome (as defined by Adult Treatment Panel, third report, guidelines) and the prevalence of its components, including abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high glucose, low HDL, and high:triglyceride concentrations. Results: The intake of vitamin D from dietary and supplemental sources was inversely related to the 20-y cumulative prevalence of abdominal obesity (P = 0.05) and high glucose (P = 0.02) and low HDL (P = 0.004) concentrations after adjustment for age, sex, race, education, center, and energy intake.

However, human studies, particularly longitudinal data, are limited. Objective: Our objective was to investigate whether dietary folate intake is associated with the 20-y incidence of hypertension. Design: We prospectively followed 4400 men and women (African Americans and whites aged 18-30 y) without hypertension at base-line (1985) in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study 6 times, in 1987, 1990, 1992, 1995, 2000, and 2005.

Results: A total of 989 incident cases were identified during the 20-y follow-up. After adjustment for potential confounders, participants in the highest quintile of total folate intake had a significantly lower incidence of hypertension (HR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.62; P-trend < 0.01) than did those in the lowest quintile.

Results: Pelvic, hip, and lumbar spine BMAT had negative correlations with hip and lumbar spine BMD(r = -0.399 to -0.550, P < 0.001). The inverse associations between BMAT and BMD remained strong after adjusting for demographics, weight, skeletal muscle, SAT, VAT, total adipose tissue (TAT), menopausal status, lifestyle factors, and inflammatory markers (standardized regression coefficients = -0. 296 to -0.549, P < 0.001). Among body composition measures, skeletal muscle was the strongest correlate of BMD after adjusting for BMAT (standardized regression coefficients = 0.268-0.614, P < 0.05), with little additional contribution from weight, SAT, VAT, or total adipose tissue. Conclusion: In this middle-aged population, a negative relationship existed between MRI-measured BMAT and hip and lumbar spine BMD independent of demographics and body composition. These observations support the growing evidence linking BMAT with low bone density.

Objective: The objective was to examine the joint and independent association between dietary pattern and diet beverage consumption with 20-y cardiometabolic risk. Design: We analyzed a prospective 20-y cohort of young adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. With the use of cluster analysis, we identified 2 baseline (year 0) dietary patterns [Prudent (higher intakes of fruit, whole grains, milk, and nuts and seeds; n = 1778) and Western (higher intakes of fast food, meat and poultry, pizza, and snacks; n = 2383)] and examined the interaction with diet beverage consumption (Consumers compared with Nonconsumers) by using proportional hazards regression models. Results: Among Consumers, 66% were classified as having a Prudent diet. In fully adjusted models, being a Nonconsumer with a Prudent diet was independently associated with a lower risk of the metabolic syndrome through year 20. Lower risk in the Prudent than in the Western dietary pattern was maintained after stratification by diet beverage consumption: Prudent Nonconsumers had the lowest risk of high waist circumference (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.97), high triglycerides (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.93), and the metabolic syndrome (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.82) compared with Western Consumers. Conclusions: Our results suggest that both overall dietary pattern and diet beverage consumption are important, to various degrees, for different metabolic outcomes. This covariation and interaction may partially explain differences in the relation between diet beverage consumption and cardiometabolic health observed in previous studies.

However, smoking quantity is a very imprecise measure of exposure to tobacco smoke constituents. Analyses of alternate phenotypes and populations may improve our understanding of tobacco addiction genetics. Cotinine is the major metabolite of nicotine, and measuring serum cotinine levels in smokers provides a more objective measure of nicotine dose than smoking quantity. Previous genetic association studies of serum cotinine have focused on individual genes. We conducted a genetic association study of the biomarker in African American (N = 365) and European American (N 315) subjects from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study using a chip containing densely-spaced tag SNPs in similar to 2100 genes. We found that rs11187065, located in the non-coding region (intron I) of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), was the most strongly associated SNP (p = 8.91 x 10(-6)) in the African American cohort, whereas rs11763963, located on chromosome 7 outside of a gene transcript, was the most strongly associated SNP in European Americans (p = 1.53 x 10(-6)). We then evaluated how the top variant association in each population performed in the other group. We found that the association of rs11187065 in IDE was also associated with the phenotype in European Americans (p = 0.044). Our top SNP association in European Americans, rs11763963 was non-polymorphic in our African American sample. It has been previously shown that psychostimulant self-administration is reduced in animals with lower insulin because of interference with dopamine transmission in the brain reward centers. Our finding provides a platform for further investigation of this, or additional mechanisms, involving the relationship between insulin and self-administered nicotine dose.

Design, setting, participants, & measurements This study compared the incidence of CKD among young African-American and white adults over 20 years of follow-up in the community-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. Participants included 4119 adults, 18-30 years of age, with an estimated GFR (eGFR) >= 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) at baseline. Incident CKD was defined as an eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a >= 25%:, decline in eGFR at study visits conducted 10, 15, and 20 years after baseline. Results At baseline, the mean age of African Americans and whites was 24 and 26 years, respectively (P<0.001), and 56% and 53% of participants, respectively, were women (P=0.06). There were 43 incident cases of CKD during follow-up, 29 (1.4%) among African Americans and 14 (0.7%) among whites (P=0.02). The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for incident CKD comparing African Americans to whites was 2.56 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.35-5.05). After further adjustment for body mass index, systolic BP, fasting plasma glucose, and HDL cholesterol, the HR was 2.51 (95% CI, 1.25-5.05). After multivariable adjustment including albuminuria at year 10, the HR for CKD at year 15 or 20 was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.52-2.41.). Conclusions In this study, the 20-year CKD incidence was higher among African Americans than whites, a difference that is explained in part by albuminuria.

Objective: We examined the longitudinal association between serum carotenoids (beta-cryptoxanthin, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein/ zeaxanthin, and lycopene) and the evolution of lung function. Design: We evaluated our hypothesis in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) prospective cohort study. Spirometry testing was conducted at year 0 (1985-1986) and at follow-up in years 2, 5, 10, and 20; serum carotenoids were assayed at years 0 and 15, and diet was assessed at years 0 and 20. Results: Year 0 sum of provitamin A carotenoids and beta-cryptoxanthin concentrations were associated with maximum forced vital capacity (FVC) (P <= 0.01) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (P <= 0.05) (maximum across years 0-10) in linear regression models adjusted for age, race, height, study center, amount of physical activity, smoking status, and BMI. Year 0 lutein/zeaxanthin and lycopene were not associated with maximum lung function. Baseline concentrations of lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, sum of the 3 provitamin A carotenoids, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin were each inversely associated with a decline from maximum FVC and FEV1 (P <= 0.04). The sum of provitamin A carotenoids and lycopene remained significant after adjustment for dietary intake related to serum carotenoids (P <= 0.03). The 15-y change in provitamin A carotenoid and lutein/zeaxanthin concentrations was associated with a slower decline from maximum FVC and FEV1 (P <= 0.04). Conclusion: These findings support an association between serum carotenoid concentrations and a decline in lung function.

Objective: We investigated the complex associations between fat mass and fat-free mass and Max(dur) in a population setting. Design: The Max(dur) of a graded exercise treadmill test and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were estimated in 2413 black and white men and women aged 38-50 y from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort. Results: The mean Max(dur) was approximate to 7.5 s shorter per kilogram of fat mass in both men and women and independent of fat-free mass, height, race, television watching, physical activity, systolic blood pressure, lung function, and education. Fat mass modified the association of fat-free mass with the Max(dur) (2-way interaction P < 0.001), and the interaction was stronger in women than in men. In men in the lowest fat-mass quartile, the Max(dur) was 1.3 s longer per kilogram of fat-free mass and was 0.5 s shorter per kilogram of fat-free mass in the highest fat-mass quartile. In contrast, in women with the least fat mass, the Max(dur) was 2.7 s longer per kilogram of fat-free mass and was 2.8 s shorter per kilogram of fat-free mass in the highest fat-mass quartile. Conclusions: The Max(dur) was negatively related to fat mass. Fat-free mass in obese people contributed little to the treadmill performance potential as assessed by the Max(dur), although the contribution of fat-free mass was positive in thinner people.

Despite a higher incidence of end-stage renal disease (stage 5), blacks have been shown to have the same or lower prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD stages 3 and 4). Current creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR)-estimating equations may misclassify young, healthy blacks. Methods. Among 3501 young adults (mean age 45), we compared the prevalence of CKD in blacks and whites using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations. In addition, we used measured creatinine excretion rates to determine the actual excretion ratio for CARDIA (race coefficient 12%) and applied this to the CKD-EPI equation. We also studied the prevalence of CKD risk factors among black and white participants near the CKD threshold cut-off (eGFR CKD-EPI 60-80 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) to estimate the relative likelihood of misclassification in blacks and whites. Results. Using the MDRD equation, prevalence of CKD stages 4 and 5 was higher for blacks compared with whites (0.6% vs. 0.1%, P-value 0.05). In contrast, prevalence of eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was significantly higher for whites (3.6%) compared with blacks (1.9%), due to higher prevalence of stage 3 among whites. Prevalence of CKD was similar for blacks and whites using CKD-EPI equation (1.2%), but was higher among blacks when using the CARDIA-derived race coefficient (1.6% vs. 1.2%, P-value = 0.03). Among persons with eGFR by CKD-EPI of 60-80 mL/min/1.73 m(2), blacks had higher levels of albuminuria, uric acid, systolic blood pressure and higher diabetes prevalence. Conclusions. CKD classification among young blacks is very sensitive to the race coefficients. Despite whites having higher rates of CKD stage 3, blacks with eGFRs just above the CKD threshold had higher rates of CKD risk factors. Current equations used to define CKD may systematically miss a high-risk group of blacks at a time in the disease course when interventions are crucial.",27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0931-0509,,NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL,Nephrol.

Objective: Our objective was to examine the relation between consumption of low- and whole-fat milk, fruit juice, and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and cardiometabolic risk factors. Design: We used data from a prospective 20-y cohort of 2774 adults. Data are taken from CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) Study examination years 0 (1985 1986), 7 (1992-1993), and 20 (2005-2006). Beverage intake was averaged across years 0 and 7, and continuous and categorical (quartile) distributions were used. Incident (year 20) high waist circumference (WC), high triglycerides, high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome were examined by using multivariable-adjusted Poisson regression models. Results: Higher SSB consumption (across quartiles) was associated with higher risk of high WC [adjusted relative risk (aRR): 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.14; P for trend < 0.001]; high LDL cholesterol (aRR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.35; P for trend = 0.018), high triglycerides (aRR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.13; P for trend = 0.033), and hypertension (aRR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.12; P for trend = 0.023). Whole-fat milk consumption was associated with lower risk of high triglycerides (aRR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.00; P for trend = 0.046). With the use of continuous beverage intake, results were similar. Consumers of whole-fat milk and SSBs were more likely to be younger, black, and male and to have lower levels of physical activity and higher total energy intake in comparison with nonconsumers (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that higher SSB consumption is associated with cardiometabolic risk.

Objective: Our objective was to study the prospective association of serum androgens and SHBG with subclinical coronary and carotid disease among young to middle-aged women. Design and Setting: This was an ancillary study to the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a population-based multicenter cohort study with 20 yr of follow-up. Participants: Participants included 1629 women with measurements of serum testosterone and SHBG from yr 2, 10, or 16 and subclinical disease assessment at yr 20 (ages 37-52 yr). Main Outcome Measures: Coronary artery calcified plaques (CAC) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) were assessed at yr 20. The IMT measure incorporated the common carotid arteries, bifurcations, and internal carotid arteries. Results: SHBG (mean of yr 2, 10, and 16) was inversely associated with the presence of CAC (multivariable adjusted odds ratio for women with SHBG levels above the median = 0.59; 95% confidence interval = 0.40-0.87; P = 0.008).

BMI at year 0 was associated positively and linearly with CAC at year 20; however, the association of BMI with year 20 CAC became progressively U-shaped in subsequent examinations (years 10, 15, and 20). To understand the deepening U shape, the authors modeled year 20 BMI and its history using 3 indices: year 0 BMI, linear slope of BMI during 20 years, and BMI fluctuation during 20 years. In models including these 3 terms, year 0 BMI was associated positively with CAC, as was BMI fluctuation. However, adjusted odds ratios across quintiles of BMI slope (vs. the lowest quintile) were 0.7, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.4 (P-trend < 0.01), suggesting higher risk of CAC with weight loss, plateauing after moderate weight gain. In contrast, IMT was associated positively with BMI at all examinations and with 20-year BMI slope and was unassociated with BMI fluctuation.

Methods: CARDIA is an ongoing longitudinal study of the risk factors for subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease. At baseline in 1985/1986, serum carotenoids were assayed and passive smoke exposure inside and outside of the home and diet were assessed by self-report. Our analytic sample consisted of 2,633 black and white non-smoking adults aged 18-30 years. Results: Greater total passive smoke exposure was associated with lower levels of the sum of the three provitamin A carotenoids, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin (-0.048 nmol/l per hour of passive smoke exposure, p = 0.001), unassociated with lutein/zeaxanthin, and associated with higher levels of lycopene (0.027 nmol/l per hour of passive smoke exposure, p = 0.010) after adjustment for demographics, diet, lipid profile, and supplement use. Exposure in both home and non-home spaces was also associated with lower levels of the provitamin A carotenoid index.

Most previous studies have been cross-sectional and relied on self-reported sleep duration, which may not be very accurate. In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Sleep Study (2000-2006), the authors examine whether objectively measured sleep is associated with BMI and change in BMI. They use several nights of wrist actigraphy to measure sleep among participants in an ongoing cohort of middle-aged adults. By use of linear regression, the authors examine whether average sleep duration or fragmentation is associated with BMI and 5-year change in BMI, adjusting for confounders. Among 612 participants, sleep duration averaged 6.1 hours and was grouped into 4 categories. Both shorter sleep and greater fragmentation were strongly associated with higher BMI in unadjusted cross-sectional analysis. After adjustment, BMI decreased by 0.78 kg/m(2) (95% confidence interval: -1.6, -0.002) for each increasing sleep category. The association was very strong in persons who reported snoring and weak in those who did not. There were no longitudinal associations between sleep measurements and change in BMI.

Objective: The objective was to evaluate the association between changes in leisure-time walking and weight gain over a 15-y period. Design: Prospective data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study of 4995 men and women aged 18-30 y at baseline (1985-1986) from 4 US cities and reexamined 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 y later. Sex-stratified, repeated-measures, conditional regression modeling with data from all 6 examination periods (n = 23,633 observations) was used to examine associations between walking and annualized 15-y weight change, with control for 15-y nonwalking physical activity, baseline weight (and their interaction), marital status, education, smoking, calorie intake, and baseline age, race, and field center. Results: Mean (+/- SE) baseline weights were 77.0 +/- 0.3 kg (men) and 66.2 +/- 0.3 kg (women), weight gain was approximate to 1 kg/ y, and the mean duration of walking at baseline was <15 min/d. After accounting for nonwalking physical activity, calorie intake, and other covariates, we found a substantial association between walking and annualized weight change; the greatest association was for those with a larger baseline weight. For example, for women at the 75th percentile of baseline weight, 0.5 h of walking/d was associated with 8 kg less weight gain over 15 y compared with women with no leisure time walking. Conclusion: Walking throughout adulthood may attenuate the longterm weight gain that occurs in most adults.

Major factors affecting plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations include folate concentrations and polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. Because U.S.-mandated fortification of grain products with folic acid has improved folate and tHcy status in Americans, we investigated the effect of the MTHFR 677C>T variant before and after fortification. We determined tHcy and folate concentrations in sera from 844 Caucasian and 587 African American participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study before and after fortification and we genotyped the MTHFR 677C>T variant. MTHFR 677TT homozygotes had higher (P < 0.01) tHcy concentrations both before and after fortification compared with MTHFR 677CC homozygotes. However, the difference between these 2 genotypes decreased from 2.5 mu mol/L before fortification to <0.7 mu mol/L postfortification (P < 0.01). In addition, the prevalence of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia (tHcy > 13 mu mol/L) in 677TT homozygotes decreased from 33% before fortification to 12% postfortification (P< 0.01). Using a cutoff value of 13 mu mol/L to define moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, the sensitivity of the MTHFR 677TT genotype to predict elevations in homocysteine was low (similar to 30%) both before and after folic acid fortification. Increasing the cutoff from 13 to 19 mu mol/L increased the sensitivity of the assay before fortification to 62% but decreased the sensitivity to 17% postfortification. We conclude that after folic acid fortification in the US, measurement of tHcy rather than genotyping of MTHFR 677TT should be used as the primary assay for the diagnosis and monitoring of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a preexisting multivariable risk score for the development of diabetes in a young adult cohort. METHODS We analyzed the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), a population-based observational study of participants aged 18 to 30 years recruited in 1985-1986. We observed individuals without diabetes at baseline for 10 years for the development of diabetes (n = 2,543). We computed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for a diabetes risk score composed of the following 6 variables: elevated blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, body mass index, large waist circumference, and hyperglycemia. RESULTS The area under the ROC curve was .70 in this population, which was less than the .78 previously found among middle-aged adults. BMI alone (.67) was not significantly different from the risk score. Blacks (.72; 95% Cl,.69-.74) and whites (.68; 95% Cl,.66-.71) do not significantly differ in the area under the ROC curve for the risk score; however, the area under the ROC curve for BMI is significantly larger for blacks (.69; 95% Cl,.66-.72) than for whites (.63; 95% Cl,.60-.65).

Self-reported reasons were considered discordant if they differed from those in medical records. Of the 321 self-reported hospitalizations, overall concordance was 92.5%; concordance ranged from 80% for infections to 100% for injuries/fractures and procedures/surgeries. There were no significant differences among mail, telephone, or face-to-face methods of collecting self-reports. In generalized estimating equations analyses, Black race (odds ratio = 4.23, 95% confidence interval: 1.72, 10.40; p = 0.002) and intravenous drug use (odds ratio = 6.06, 95% confidence interval: 1.17, 31.22; p = 0.03) were positively associated with discordance.

We examined the relationship between a common, functional polymorphism of the human sEH gene and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in young, largely asymptomatic African-American and non-Hispanic white subjects. Methods and Results - Multiple logistic regression and Tobit regression models were used to assess the relationship between the sEH Arg287Gln polymorphism and presence and quantity of CAC. Models adjusting for race ( except in race-specific analyses), age, sex, smoking, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol were estimated. Allele and genotype frequency distributions were not significantly different between the 2 ethnic groups ( P = 0.22; P = 0.17, respectively). The Arg287Gln polymorphism of the sEH gene was a significant predictor of CAC status in African-American participants, either alone or after adjusting for other risk factors. African-American subjects with at least 1 copy of the Gln287 allele had a 2-fold greater risk of having CAC compared with those not carrying this allele (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.9; P = 0.02). There was no relationship between Arg287Gln polymorphism and the probability of having CAC in white participants ( OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.3; P = 0.49). Inferences from multivariable Tobit regression were similar to those obtained in the logistic regression models, indicating that the Arg287Gln polymorphism was a significant independent predictor of both presence and quantity of CAC in African-American but not white subjects.

Methods: We used data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study of 5115 adults aged 18-30 years at baseline and interviewed 7 times between 1985 and 2006. We estimated marginal structural models using inverse probability-of-treatment and censoring weights to assess the association between point-in-time/cumulative exposure to neighborhood poverty (proportion of census tract residents living in poverty) and alcohol use/binging, after accounting for time-dependent confounders including income, education, and occupation. Results: The log-normal model was used to estimate treatment weights while accounting for highly-skewed continuous neighborhood poverty data. In the weighted model, a one-unit increase in neighborhood poverty at the prior examination was associated with a 86% increase in the odds of binging (OR = 1.86 [95% confidence interval = 1.14-3.03]); the estimate from a standard generalized-estimating-equations model controlling for baseline and time-varying covariates was 1.47 (0.96-2.25).

Linear regression was used to adjust for demographic factors, cardiovascular risk factors, tobacco smoking, use of alcohol and illicit drugs, physical activity, depression, and results of the mirror star tracing test (a measure of cognitive function) at year 2. Data analysis was conducted from June 7, 1986, to August 31, 2011. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Three domains of cognitive function were assessed at year 25 using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (verbal memory), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (processing speed), and the Stroop Interference Test (executive function). RESULTS Among 3385 participants with cognitive function measurements at the year 25 visit, 2852 (84.3%) reported past marijuana use, but only 392 (11.6%) continued to use marijuana into middle age. Current use of marijuana was associated with worse verbal memory and processing speed; cumulative lifetime exposure was associated with worse performance in all 3 domains of cognitive function. After excluding current users and adjusting for potential confounders, cumulative lifetime exposure to marijuana remained significantly associated with worse verbal memory. For each 5 years of past exposure, verbal memory was 0.13 standardized units lower (95% CI, -0.24 to -0.02; P =.02), corresponding to a mean of 1 of 2 participants remembering 1 word fewer from a list of 15 words for every 5 years of use.

Persons with obesity experience discrimination because of their body weight. Across 3 studies, we tested for the first time whether experiencing (perceived) weight-based discrimination explains why obesity is prospectively associated with increases in depressive symptoms. Method: Data from 3 studies, including the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2008/2009-2012/2013), the Health and Retirement Study (2006/2008-2010/2012), and Midlife in the United States (1995/1996-2004/2005), were used to examine associations between obesity, perceived weight discrimination, and depressive symptoms among 20,286 U.S. and U.K. adults. Results: Across all 3 studies, Class II and III obesity were reliably associated with increases in depressive symptoms from baseline to follow-up. Perceived weight-based discrimination predicted increases in depressive symptoms over time and mediated the prospective association between obesity and depressive symptoms in all 3 studies. Persons with Class II and III obesity were more likely to report experiencing weight-based discrimination, and this explained approximately 31% of the obesity-related increase in depressive symptoms on average across the 3 studies. Conclusion: In U.S. and U.K. samples, the prospective association between obesity (defined using body mass index) and increases in depressive symptoms in adulthood may in part be explained by perceived weight discrimination.",29,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0278-6133,1930-7810,HEALTH PSYCHOL,Health Psychol.,FEB,2017,36,2,112,121,,10.1037/hea0000426,10,"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology",Psychology,WOS:000395505000002,27748611,"Green Published, Green Accepted, Other Gold",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The large DIF by race/ethnicity in the index for racial/ethnic discrimination probably reflects item impact and is the result of valid group differences between blacks and whites regarding their respective experiences of discrimination. The authors also observed large DIF by race/ethnicity for 3 of 7 gender discrimination items. This is more likely to have been due to item bias.

We hypothesized that structural and physiologic MR imaging findings of early cerebrovascular disease can be measured in middle-aged subjects in tissue adjacent to WM lesions, termed ""penumbra."" MATERIALS AND METHODS: WM lesions were defined using automated segmentation in 463 subjects, 43-56 years of age, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) longitudinal observational cohort study. We described 0- to 2-mm and 2- to 4-mm-thick spatially defined penumbral WM tissue ROIs as rings surrounding WM lesions. The remaining WM was defined as distant normal-appearing WM. Mean signal intensities were measured for FLAIR, T1-, and T2-weighted images, and from fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, CBF, and vascular reactivity maps. Group comparisons were made using Kruskal-Wallis and pair-wise t tests. RESULTS: Lesion volumes averaged 0.738 +/- 0.842 cm(3) (range, 0.005-7.27 cm(3)). Mean signal intensity for FLAIR, T2, and mean diffusivity was increased, while T1, fractional anisotropy, and CBF were decreased in white matter lesions versus distant normal-appearing WM, with penumbral tissues showing graded intermediate values (corrected P < .001 for all group/parameter comparisons). Vascular reactivity was significantly elevated in white matter lesions and penumbral tissue compared with distant normal-appearing white matter (corrected P <= .001). CONCLUSIONS: Even in relatively healthy 43- to 56-year-old subjects with small white matter lesion burden, structural and functional MR imaging in penumbral tissue reveals significant signal abnormalities versus white matter lesions and other normal WM.

Understanding these relationships is essential for addressing residential self-selection bias. Methods Using 25 years (6 examinations) of data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (n=11 013 observations) and linked neighbourhood-level data from the 4 CARDIA baseline cities (Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Oakland, California, USA), we characterised participants' neighbourhoods as having low, average or high road connectivity and amenities using non-hierarchical cluster analysis. We then used repeated measures multinomial logistic regression with random effects to examine the associations between individual-level sociodemographics and neighbourhood-level characteristics with residential neighbourhood types over the 25-year period, and whether these associations differed by individual-level income. Results Being female was positively associated with living in neighbourhoods with low (vs high) road connectivity and activity-related and diet-related amenities among high-income individuals only. At all income levels, a higher percentage of neighbourhood white population and neighbourhood population <18 years were associated with living in neighbourhoods with low (vs high) connectivity and amenities. Individual-level race; age; and educational attainment, neighbourhood socioeconomic status and housing prices did not influence residential location behaviour related to neighbourhood connectivity and amenities at any income level. Conclusions Neighbourhood-level factors appeared to play a comparatively greater role in shaping residential location behaviour than individual-level sociodemographics.

Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for daily breakfast consumption were as follows: abdominal obesity HR 0.78 (95% CI 0.66-0.91), obesity 0.80 (0.67-0.96), metabolic syndrome 0.82 (0.69-0.98), and hypertension 0.84 (0.72-0.99). For type 2 diabetes, the corresponding estimate was 0.81 (0.63-1.05), with a significant stepwise inverse association in black men and white men and women but no association in black women.

Few, if any, human studies have examined the association between mercury exposure and diabetes incidence. We examined whether toenail mercury levels are associated with incidence of diabetes in a large prospective cohort. RESEACH DESIGN AND METHODS-A prospective cohort of 3,875 American young adults, aged 20-32 years, free of diabetes in 1987 (baseline), were enrolled and followed six times until 2005. Baseline toenail mercury levels were measured with instrumental neutron-activation analysis. Incident diabetes was identified by plasma glucose levels, oral glucose tolerance tests, hemoglobin AlC levels, and/or antidiabetes medications. RESULTS-A total of 288 incident cases of diabetes occurred over 18 years of follow-up. In multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, study center, education, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, family history of diabetes, intakes of long-chain n-3 fatty acids and magnesium, and toenail selenium, toenail mercury levels were positively associated with the incidence of diabetes. The hazard ratio (95% CI) of incident diabetes compared the highest to the lowest quintiles of mercury exposure was 1.65 (1.07-2.56; P for trend = 0.02). Higher mercury exposure at baseline was also significantly associated with decreased homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function index (P for trend < 0.01).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort study of 5,115 white and black adults aged 18-30 years in 1985 to 1986. Years spent abdominally obese were calculated for participants without abdominal obesity (WC >102 cm in men and >88 cm in women) or diabetes at baseline (n = 4,092) and was based upon repeat measurements conducted 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years later.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Participants were 1,399 women (39% black, aged 18-30 years) in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, an ongoing multicenter, population-based, prospective observational cohort study conducted in the U.S. Women were nulliparous and free of the metabolic syndrome at baseline (1985-1986) and before subsequent pregnancies, and reexamined 7, 10, 15, and/or 20 years after baseline. Incident metabolic syndrome case participants were identified according to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria. Complementary log-log models estimated relative hazards of incident metabolic syndrome among time-dependent lactation duration categories by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) adjusted for age, race, study center, baseline covariates (BMI, metabolic syndrome components, education, smoking, physical activity), and time-dependent parity. RESULTS-Among 704 parous women (620 non-GDM, 84 GDM), there were 120 incident metabolic syndrome case participants in 9,993 person-years (overall incidence rate 12.0 per 1,000 person-years; 10.8 for non-GDM, 22.1 for GDM). Increased lactation duration was associated with lower crude metabolic syndrome incidence rates from 0-1 month through >9 months (P < 0.001). Fully adjusted relative hazards showed that risk reductions associated with longer lactation were stronger among GDM (relative hazard range 0.14-0.56; P = 0.03) than non-GDM groups (relative hazard range 0.44-0.61; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS-Longer duration of lactation was associated with lower incidence of the metabolic syndrome years after weaning among women with a history of GDM and without GDM, controlling for preconception measurements, BMI, and sociodemographic and lifestyle traits.

Therefore, we examined the association between dietary pattern scores created to reflect the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) Scientific Report, a Palaeolithic (Palaeo) diet, a diet high in 'empty calories', and the A Priori Diet Quality Score (APDQS) (cohort reference) and type 2 diabetes risk over time. Methods We carried out a prospective analysis of 4719 young adult black and white men and women from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study with repeated dietary histories collected at study years 0, 7 and 20. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, we examined the association between time-dependent cumulative average dietary pattern scores and incident type 2 diabetes. Results During the 30 year follow-up period, 680 (14.4%) incident cases of type 2 diabetes occurred. There was no association between the 2015 DGA, Palaeo or empty calorie scores and type 2 diabetes risk in the overall population. Participants in the fourth quartile of the APDQS, reflecting a more healthful dietary pattern, had a 45% lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared with those in the lowest quartile (HR 0.55 [95% CI 0.41, 0.74]).

This study aimed to examine cannabis-attributable immunomodulation as manifested in levels of fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). METHODS: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is a cohort of 5115 African-American and Caucasian males and females enrolled in 1985-1986, and followed up for over 25 years, with repeated measures of cannabis use. Fibrinogen levels were measured at year 5, year 7, and year 20, CRP levels were measured at year 7, year 15, year 20, and year 25, and IL-6 levels were measured at year 20. We estimated the association of cannabis use and each biomarker using generalized estimating equations adjusting for demographic factors, tobacco cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, and body mass index. RESULTS: Compared with never use (reference), recent cannabis use was not associated with any of the biomarkers studied here after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Former cannabis use was inversely associated with fibrinogen levels (beta = -5.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], -9.9, -0.9), whereas the associations were weaker for serum CRP (beta = -0.02; 95% CI, -0.10, 0.06) and IL-6 (beta = -0.06; 95% CI, -0.13, 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: A modest inverse association between former cannabis use and fibrinogen was observed.

However, research informing this topic in young adults is limited. Objective: This study examined the association between ASB, SSB, and total sweetened beverage (TSB; combined ASB and SSB) consumption and T2D risk in young adults. Methods: A prospective analysis of 4719 Black and White men and women aged 18-30 y at baseline was conducted from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Each participant's beverage intake was assessed using the CARDIA Diet History at baseline and at study Years 7 and 20. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine cumulative average ASB, SSB, and TSB intakes and risk of T2D. Results: During the 30-y follow-up period, 680 participants developed T2D. ASB consumption was associated with a 12% greater risk of T2D per serving/day (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04-1.20) in a model adjusted for lifestyle factors, diet quality, and dieting behavior. Further adjustments for baseline BMI (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99-1.14) and weight change during follow-up (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97-1.12) attenuated the association. SSB and TSB consumption as continuous variables per 1 serving/day of intake were associated with 6% and 5% increased risks of T2D, respectively (HRSSB 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.10; HRTSB 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09), in the model accounting for lifestyle factors, dieting behavior, baseline BMI, and weight change.

There are limited data on the prevalence of these stages in early adulthood and predictors of HF stage and symptoms in middle age. Methods and Results: The CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults)-a cohort of generally healthy black and white men and women-collected phenotypic, echocardiographic, and outcomes data at the year 5 and year 30 examinations when participants were 22 to 37 and 47 to 62 years of age. Prevalence of HF stages was calculated and relationship of year 5 stage to year 30 classification and outcomes was assessed. At year 5, 2189 participants had complete data. Prevalence of HF stage A/B increased from 24% to 76% in black men, from 13% to 64% in white men, from 34% to 81% in black women, and from 13% to 56% in white women. Blacks were more likely to be in any stage or with morbidity at both time points because of higher risk factor prevalence. Of 33 participants with HF or HF deaths by year 30, 21 (64%) had been in stage A or B at year 5. Only 6 participants at year 5 in stage A (at risk) improved risk status at year 30.

The aim of this study was to determine trajectories of CVH from early adulthood to middle age, and examine their association with HRQoL in middle age. This analysis, conducted in 2018, included 3275 participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who completed a year 30 follow-up exam in 2015/2016. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to create CVH trajectories, according to American Heart Association definitions, from baseline through follow-up year 20.

Whether early onset hypertension also promotes the development of target end-organ damage (TOD), even by midlife, has remained unknown. We studied 2680 middle-aged CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) Study participants (mean age 50 +/- 4 years, 57% women) who underwent up to 8 serial blood pressure measurements between 1985 and 2011 (age range at baseline 18-30 years) in addition to assessments of echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary calcification, albuminuria, and diastolic dysfunction in 2010 to 2011. Age of hypertension onset was defined as the age at first of 2 consecutively attended examinations with blood pressure >= 140/90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication. Participants were divided in groups by hypertension onset age (<35 years, 35-44 years, >= 45 years, or no hypertension). While adjusting for TOD risk factors, including systolic blood pressure, we used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for cases (participants with TOD) versus controls (participants without TOD) to examine the relation of hypertension onset age and hypertensive TOD. Compared with normotensive individuals, hypertension onset at age <35 years was related to odds ratios of 2.29 (95% CI, 1.36-3.86), 2.94 (95% CI, 1.57-5.49), 1.12 (95% CI, 0.55-2.29), and 2.06 (95% CI, 1.04-4.05) for left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary calcification, albuminuria, and diastolic dysfunction, respectively.

Earlier age at natural menopause is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and stroke. Despite extensive study, no clear and conclusive association between anthropometric measures and age at natural menopause has emerged. This study aims to assess whether baseline and/or longitudinal changes in adiposity are associated with age at natural menopause. Methods: In all, 2,030 premenopausal women from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study-a prospective study with 25 years follow-up-were included for analysis from 1985 to 1986 until menopause was attained. Anthropometry included body mass index and waist circumference. Discrete-time survival analysis was then used to determine the association between anthropometric measures at baseline, and also their changes with age at natural menopause, while adjusting for various time-varying and invariant covariates in separate models for body mass index and waist circumference. Results: Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that baseline body mass index (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-0.98) and baseline waist circumference (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99) significantly increased the risk of later age at natural menopause. Neither time-varying body mass index nor waist circumference indicating change across time associated with age at natural menopause. Premenopausal hypertension was strongly associated with an earlier age at natural menopause.

Design and methods: In this prospective cohort study we examined the association of biomarkers of dietary intake with kidney function decline over a 5-year interval in 2,152 men and women with cystatin-C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate > 60 mL/minute/1.73 m(2) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. The biomarkers of interest included carotenoids, tocopherols, and ascorbic acid. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between serum concentrations of the sum of 4 carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and lutein/zeaxanthin), lycopene, gamma-tocopherol, y-tocopherol, and ascorbic acid and rapid kidney function decline, defined as .15% decline in cystatin-C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate over 5 years. Results: During the 5-year follow-up, 290 participants (13.5%) experienced rapid kidney function decline. Relative to individuals in the lowest quartile of serum carotenoids, those in the highest quartile had significantly lower odds of rapid kidney function decline in the fully adjusted model (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.80; P trend, .02). No association of levels of serum tocopherols, ascorbic acid, or lycopene with kidney function decline was found. There was no evidence that results differed for individuals with hypertension or diabetes. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that higher serum carotenoid levels, reflective of a fruit- and vegetable-rich dietary pattern, inversely associate with rapid kidney function decline in early middle adulthood and provide insight into how diet might play a role in chronic kidney disease prevention.

Methods: Using data from the CARDIA study, we investigated the association between peak lung-function and long-term BPV in 2917 individuals (mean age 24.8 years, 45.3% males, 58.6% whites) who were not taking antihypertensive medications. Lung-function was measured using forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1-s (FEV1) at years 0, 2, 5, 10 and 20 and the maximum score attained was considered as peak lung-function. Variability independent of the mean (VIM) and coefficient of variation (CV) of BP were calculated to quantify BPV since achieving peak lung-function across 9 visits over 30 years. Results: In a multivariate linear regression models, individuals in the 2nd (-0.64 mmHg; 95% CI: -1.06, -0.19), 3rd (-0.96; -1.47, -0.45), and 4th (-0.85: -1.53, -0.17) quartiles of FVC had lower VIM of systolic BP than the those in quartile 1 (p-trend 0.005). CV of systolic BP was also lower by -0.58 (-0.98, -0.19), -0.92 (-1.42, -0.43), and -0.74 (-1.40, -0.08) percentage points, in the three progressively higher quartiles of FVC compared to quartile 1 (p-trend 0.008). Similar findings were observed when the outcome was diastolic BPV. There was no association of FEV1 and FEV1-to-FVC ratio with BPV. Conclusions: These findings suggest that smaller lung volume or restrictive lung disease during young adulthood, which result in lower peak FVC, may independently increase the risk of higher long-term BPV during middle adulthood.

Although some studies indeed found cross-sectional associations of depression with LTL and mtDNAcn, the longitudinal associations remain unclear. This 10-year longitudinal study examined between-and within-person associations of depressive symptoms with LTL and mtDNAcn in a large community sample. Data are from years 15, 20 and 25 follow-up evaluations in 977 subjects from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. Depressive symptoms (years 15, 20, 25) were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale; LTL (years 15, 20, 25) and mtDNAcn (years 15, 25) were measured in whole blood by quantitative PCR. With mixed-model analyses, we explored between-and within-person associations between CES-D scores and cellular aging markers. Results showed that high levels of depressive symptomatology throughout the 10-year time span was associated with shorter average LTL over 10 years (B = -4.2; P = 0.014) after covarying for age, sex, race and education. However, no within-person association was found between depressive symptoms and LTL at each year (B = -0.8; P = 0.548). Further, we found no between-person (B = -0.2; P = 0.744) or within-person (B = 0.4; P = 0.497) associations between depressive symptomatology and mtDNAcn. Our results provide evidence for a long-term, between-person relationship of depressive symptoms with LTL, rather than a dynamic and direct within-person relationship. In this study, we found no evidence for an association between depressive symptoms and mtDNAcn.",21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1359-4184,1476-5578,MOL PSYCHIATR,Mol.

Differing exposure to obesogenic environments in segregated neighborhoods may contribute to racial disparities in obesity prevalence. Methods: We used prospective data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study to examine associations between levels of neighborhood-level racial residential segregation and incident obesity in black men and women. Obesity, determined by measured anthropometry, and residential segregation, measured using the local G(i)*statistic, were recorded at baseline and follow-up at years 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25. We used marginal structural survival models to account for time-dependent confounding and for loss to follow-up. Results: Black women living in highly segregated neighborhoods at the prior exam were 30% more likely to become obese during the follow-up period as compared with women living in neighborhoods with low levels of segregation after adjustment for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk covariates (hazard ratio = 1.3 [95% confidence interval = 1.0, 1.7]). Cumulatively high exposure to segregation averaged across time points was associated with 50% higher hazard of obesity (hazard ratio = 1.5 [95% confidence interval = 1.0, 2.3]) among women. We observed few differences in obesity incidence among men by segregation levels. Conclusions: Fewer health-promoting resources, stressful neighborhood context, and social norms that are less stigmatizing of obesity may contribute to these findings, but more research on specific pathways leading from segregation to obesity is needed to understand differing patterns between men and women.",6,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1044-3983,1531-5487,EPIDEMIOLOGY,Epidemiology,MAR,2018,29,2,207,214,,10.1097/EDE.0000000000000792,8,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",WOS:000424955200013,29280853,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Questionnaire-based assessment of these behaviors is important for large-scale research on eating behaviors. The questionnaire on eating and weight patterns-revised (QEWP-R) measures potential problematic behaviors and attitudes toward food (including anxieties, compensatory actions, overeating and loss of control, dieting, and shape concerns) that in aggregate may indicate diagnosable eating disorders. An important question regards the prevalence of these issues and their longitudinal associations with body mass index (BMI) in generally healthy middle aged adults. MethodBased on eight constructs measured on QEWP-R, we created a new problematic relationship to eating and food (PREF) scale by assigning a point for each construct endorsed. Analyses were conducted in 3,892 black and white men and women participating in the community-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. The QEWP-R was administered in CARDIA year 10, when participants were aged 27-41 years. We used linear regression to model the relationship of individual constructs and the PREF scale to BMI over CARDIA follow-up. ResultsFifty-five percent of participants had 1-5 points and 4% had 6-8 points on the PREF scale. Each separate construct was positively associated with BMI, except concern about weight and shape. Adjusting for age, race, sex, education, and study center, mean BMI at CARDIA year 10, the time of PREF assessment, was approximately 1.0-2.5 kg/m(2) higher per PREF category.

Methods: Data are from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study a bi-ethnic, prospective, multi-center epidemiological study, initiated in 1985-1986 to track the development of cardiovascular risk in young adulthood (N = 5115). At the year 15 follow-up when participants were between 32 and 45 years of age, additional social and biological data were collected; biological data used to assess AL were collected at the Oakland, CA and Chicago, IL sites (N = 844). Results: Social strains were most strongly and positively related to overall AL (Cohen's d =.79 for highest vs. lowest quartile), and to each of its component biological subsystems, independent of social ties and support as well as sociodemographics and health behaviors. Social ties and emotional support were also negatively related to AL (Cohen's d =.33 and d =.44 for lowest vs. highest quartiles of ties and support, respectively) though controls for social strains reduced these associations to non-significance. Social support and social strain were more strongly related to overall AL than to any of its component subscales while social ties were less strongly related to AL and to its component subscales. There was no evidence that effects differed by sex, age or ethnicity. Conclusions: Findings focus attention on the particularly strong relationship between social strains and profiles of biological risk and support the cumulative impact of social factors on biological risks, showing larger effects for cumulative AL than for any of the individual biological systems.

J,"Hudson, DL; Puterrnan, E; Bibbins-Domingo, K; Matthews, KA; Adler, NE","Race, life course socioeconomic position, racial discrimination, depressive symptoms and self-rated health",SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Article,"Greater levels of socioeconomic position (SEP) are generally associated with better health. However results from previous studies vary across race/ethnicity and health outcomes. Further, the majority of previous studies do not account for the effects of life course SEP on health nor the effects of racial discrimination, which could moderate the effects of SEP on health. Using data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, we examined the relationship between a life course SEP measure on depressive symptoms and self-rated health. A life course SEP was constructed for each participant, using a framework that included parental education and occupation along with respondents' highest level of education and occupation. Interaction terms were created between life course SEP and racial discrimination to determine whether the association between SEP and health was moderated by experiences of racial discrimination. Analyses revealed that higher levels of life course SEP were inversely related to depressive symptoms. Greater life course SEP was positively associated with favorable self-rated health. Racial discrimination was associated with more depressive symptoms and poorer self-rated health. Analyses indicated a significant interaction between life course SEP and racial discrimination on depressive symptoms in the full sample. This suggested that for respondents with greater levels of SEP, racial discrimination was associated with reports of more depressive symptoms. Future research efforts should be made to examine whether individuals' perceptions and experiences of racial discrimination at the interpersonal and structural levels limits their ability to acquire human capital as well as their advancement in education and occupational status.

CARDIA is a medical cohort study with twenty years of social background data and a continuous measure of skin color, recorded as the percent of light reflected off skin. For Black men and women, we find a one-standard-deviation increase in skin lightness to be associated with a quarter-year increase in educational attainment. For White women, we find an association approximately equal in magnitude to that found for Black respondents, and the pattern of significance across educational transitions suggests that skin color for White women is not simply a proxy for family background. For White men, any relationship between skin color and attainment is not robust and, analyses suggest, might primarily reflect differences in family background. Findings suggest that discrimination on the basis of skin color may be less specific to race than previously thought. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to identify the determinants of PH in young adults. Methods: We analysed a limited access dataset from the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study provided by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Pulmonary arterial pressure was assessed by the Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT). Socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported clinical variables, echocardiographic variables, pulmonary function tests, systemic blood pressure and body mass index calculated from height and weight were used in multivariate analysis. Results: There were 4171 study subjects, mean age 24.9 +/- 3.6 years, retained in year five with echocardiographic data available after five years of follow-up. The prevalence of severe PH (PAAT = 70 ms) and mild to moderate PH (PAAT = 109.970.01 ms) was 1.1% and 14% respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that body mass index (beta = -1.09, p < 0.0001), female gender (beta = 6.25, p < 0.0001), age (beta = -0.30, p = 0.02), African American race (beta = -2.57, p = 0.007), physical activity (beta = 0.005, p = 0.002), current smoking (beta = -3.42, p = 0.001), left atrial dimension (beta = -2.97, p = 0.009) and diastolic dysfunction (beta = -13.06, p = 0.006) were statistically significant variables predicting PH.

Using momentary assessment, we evaluated associations between average positive and negative mood states and diurnal mood patterns, with prevalent and incident coronary artery calcification (CAC), a measure of calcified atherosclerosis. Methods: In a prospective cohort study of 669 white and African American men and women, aged 33 to 45 years, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, mood was assessed at Year 15 examination, six times over a weekday. Prevalent, progressive, and 5-year incident CAC (any detectable CAC [score >0]) and substantial CAC (CAC score >= 20) were assessed at examinations at Years 15 and 20 by electron-beam tomographic scans. We employed a modified Poisson regression approach for binary data with robust error estimation to quantify relative risk. Results: In multivariate-adjusted analyses, those with high-average positive mood that improved over a day had a lower risk of prevalent CAC higher than 0 (relative risk [RR] = 0.17 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 0.04-0.67]) and substantial CAC (RR = 0.25 [95% CI = 0.06-0.95]). In contrast, those with high-average, increasingly negative mood over a day had a higher risk of prevalent CAC (RR = 1.85 [95% CI = 0.86-3.99]) and substantial CAC (RR = 3.11 [95% Cl = 1.29-7.49]). Findings were similar for progressive CAC at Year 20. This pattern of high/worsening negative mood (not positive mood) during the day was also predictive of 5-year incident CAC (RR = 2.99 [95% CI = 1.00-8.93]).

This study examines whether physical activity modifies the concurrent and prospective relation between financial strain and impaired fasting glucose. Methods: Participants were part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, a prospective study examining the development of disease. Participants were recruited in 1985 to 1986 and followed up for 20 years. The outcome measures were fasting glucose (FG) levels at Years 7 and 20. FG was available at Years 7 and 20 from 3991 and 3500 participants, respectively. Results: The effects of financial strain on elevated glucose levels differed by physical activity levels as indicated by the significant interaction terms for the analyses of covariance at Year 7 (p = .02) and Year 20 (p = .04). Planned contrast comparisons demonstrated that FG levels in financially strained participants who were physically inactive were significantly different from financially strained participants who were active, and all participants with low financial strain. Specifically, in less active participants, the adjusted mean PG levels were higher in financially strained participants (2.27 mg/dL at Year 7 and 5.86 mg/dL at Year 20). In active participants, these differences were -1.78 mg/dL at Year 7 and negligible at Year 20.

Methods and results: We examined associations of telomerase activity levels measured at year 15 in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study with prevalent coronary artery calcium (CAC), progressive CAC at year 20, and incident CAC between years 15 and 20, in 440 black and white men aged 33-45 years. Telomere length was also measured in a subset of participants (N = 129). In multivariate-adjusted analysis, higher quartiles of telomerase were cross-sectionally associated with greater odds of prevalent CAC at year 15 (quartile 2: OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 0.54-3.23; quartile 3: OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 0.60-3.30; quartile 4: OR = 3.27, 95% CI: 1.39-7.71 compared with quartile 1, p-continuous = 0.012) and progressive CAC at year 20, but telomerase was not significantly associated with incidence of newly detectable CAC. Higher telomerase activity levels predicted greater CAC progression at year 20 among persons with short telomere length; low telomerase and short TL predicted less CAC progression.

J,"Chambers, EC; Schechter, C; Tow, A; Torrens, L; Kohlieber, R; Calderon, R",HOUSEHOLD DENSITY AND OBESITY IN YOUNG BLACK AND WHITE ADULTS,ETHNICITY & DISEASE,Article,Racial and ethnic disparities in obesity persist despite a narrowing in obesity risk associated with socioeconomic status. The household environment has been shown to be important in understanding obesity-promoting behaviors in diverse populations. Our current study was designed to examine the relationship between household density and obesity in young Black and White adults aged 18-30 years from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort. All sociodemographic and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) information for this study was collected by questionnaire between 1990-1991. Height was collected using a mounted centimeter ruler. Weight was measured on a balance beam scale. Obesity was defined as a body mass index >= 30 kg/m.(2) Household density (HD) was defined as the ratio of people to bedrooms in the home. High HD was defined as a ratio > 1. Bivariate analysis showed that more women tend to live in high density households compared to men (45.4% vs 38.9%; P<.01) and more Blacks tend to live in high density households compared to Whites (53.7% vs 31.8%). Leisure-time physical activity index was lower in Blacks than in Whites (2.5% vs 2.6%; P<.01). Blacks had a higher prevalence of obesity than Whites (27.1% vs 11.8%; P<.01). Logistic regression analysis showed that Black women within high HD were at highest risk for obesity compared to White women living within low HD (OR=4.88%; 95% CI: 3.56-6.67). HD may provide an important context in understanding racial disparities in obesity-promoting behaviors.

Objective: To assess whether nonoptimal lipid levels during young adulthood cause atherosclerotic changes that persist into middle age. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: 4 cities in the United States. Participants: 3258 participants from the 5115 black and white men and women recruited at age 18 to 30 years in 1985 to 1986 for the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study. Measurements: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and coronary calcium. Time-averaged cumulative exposures to lipids between age 20 and 35 years were estimated by using repeated serum lipid measurements over 20 years in the CARDIA study; these measurements were then related to coronary calcium scores assessed later in life (45 years [SD, 4]). Results: 2824 participants (87%) had nonoptimal levels of LDL cholesterol (>= 2.59 mmol/L [>= 100 mg/dL]), HDL cholesterol (<1.55 mmol/L [<60 mg/dL]), or triglycerides (>= 1.70 mmol/L [>= 150 mg/dL]) during young adulthood. Coronary calcium prevalence 2 decades later was 8% in participants who maintained optimal LDL levels (<1.81 mmol/L [<70 mg/dL]), and 44% in participants with LDL cholesterol levels of 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) or greater (P < 0.001). The association was similar across race and sex and strongly graded, with odds ratios for coronary calcium of 1.5 (95% CI, 0.7 to 3.3) for LDL cholesterol levels of 1.81 to 2.56 mmol/L (70 to 99 mg/dL), 2.4 (CI, 1.1 to 5.3) for levels of 2.59 to 3.34 mmol/L (100 to 129 mg/dL), 3.3 (CI, 1.3 to 7.8) for levels of 3.37 to 4.12 mmol/L (130 to 159 mg/dL), and 5.6 (CI, 2.0 to 16) for levels of 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) or greater, compared with levels less than 1.81 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL), after adjustment for lipid exposure after age 35 years and other coronary risk factors. Both LDL and HDL cholesterol levels were independently associated with coronary calcium after participants who were receiving lipid-lowering medications or had clinically abnormal lipid levels were excluded. Limitation: Coronary calcium, although a strong predictor of future coronary heart disease, is not a clinical outcome. Conclusion: Nonoptimal levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol during young adulthood are independently associated with coronary atherosclerosis 2 decades later.",63,AMER COLL PHYSICIANS,PHILADELPHIA,"INDEPENDENCE MALL WEST 6TH AND RACE ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-1572 USA",0003-4819,1539-3704,ANN INTERN MED,Ann.

We aimed to determine whether such an association exists in community-dwelling young adults. Methods: This is a cohort study of participants in the ongoing, community-based, prospective Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (n = 4,055). Phosphate levels were measured at year 0, and left ventricular hypertrophy assessed by echocardiography at year 5. Results: The mean age was 25.0 years. Mean values were: estimated glomerular filtration rate 118.5 ml/min/1.73 m(2); phosphate 3.7 mg/dl; left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area 80.5 g/m(2), and indexed to height(2.7) 35.2 g/m(2.7). Left ventricular hypertrophy was present in 4.5% of the population. As a continuous variable, the phosphate level was associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (odds ratio per standard deviation 1.27; 95% confidence interval 1.09-1.47; p = 0.0020). This association persisted after covariate adjustment (odds ratio per standard deviation 1.30; 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.54; p = 0.0018), and was most pronounced for fifth quintile phosphate levels (>4.0 mg/dl). Conclusion: Phosphate level may be a risk factor for left ventricular hypertrophy in community-dwelling young adults. As phosphate levels may be modifiable, the causality of this association can be addressed with controlled trials. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

Objective: To measure the association between prehypertension exposure before age 35 years and coronary calcium later in life. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Four communities in the United States. Participants: Black and white men and women age 18 to 30 years recruited for the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) Study in 1985 through 1986 who were without hypertension before age 35 years. Measurements: Blood pressure trajectories for each participant were estimated by using measurements from 7 examinations over the course of 20 years. Cumulative exposure to blood pressure in the prehypertension range (systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg) from age 20 to 35 years was calculated in units of mm Hg-years (similar to pack-years of tobacco exposure) and related to the presence of coronary calcium measured at each participant's last examination (mean age, 44 years [SD, 4]). Results: Among 3560 participants, the 635 (18%) who developed prehypertension before age 35 years were more often black, male, overweight, and of lower socioeconomic status. Exposure to prehypertension before age 35 years, especially systolic prehypertension, showed a graded association with coronary calcium later in life (coronary calcium prevalence of 15%, 24%, and 38% for 0, 1 to 30, and > 30 mm Hg-years of exposure, respectively; P < 0.001). This association remained strong after adjustment for blood pressure elevation after age 35 years and other coronary risk factors and participant characteristics. Limitation: Coronary calcium, although a strong predictor of future coronary heart disease, is not a clinical outcome.

Study design and setting: We studied 1355 participants from the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study who were taking prescription medications in 2000-1. Medication adherence, as rated on the four-item Morisky medication adherence scale (score of 4 = maximum adherence), was reported for all participants. Results: The mean age +/- SD of participants was 40 +/- 3.6 years; 45% were African American and 36% were male. Overall, Whites had a higher proportion of maximum adherence than African Americans (59 vs 41%, respectively; p = 0.001). However, this difference was statistically significant only for participants within the normal weight category, of whom 54% of Whites were maximally adherent versus 35% of African Americans (p < 0.05). After adjustment for possible confounding covariates, race/ethnicity was associated with adherence only in those of normal weight: the odds ratio for maximum adherence in Whites versus African Americans of normal weight was 1.98 (95% CI 1.13, 3.47). Within race/ethnicity subgroups, weight category was associated with adherence in Whites but not in African Americans.

The aims of this study were to determine whether this pattern applies to the population as a whole and to identify those for whom heavy drinking in early adulthood does lead to continued high levels of consumption throughout the life course. Method: Patterns of heavy drinking were assessed, and a mixture model was used to evaluate relationships between psychological profiles and trajectories of heavy drinking in early to middle adulthood for race-gender-groups. Subjects (N= 5,115; 55% women) were drawn from the longitudinal study of Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) conducted in four major U.S. cities from 1985 to 1995. Results: Patterns of heavy drinking differed by race and gender, with higher rates observed among whites and men. Heavy drinking was generally most common in the early 20s and dropped sharply thereafter. For a subset with psychological profiles characterized by elevated levels of hostility, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, high rates of heavy drinking persisted into later adulthood; 20% of whites and 50% of blacks in the overall sample were in this subset.

Objective: We investigated the relations of waist girth and waist-hip ratio (WHR) to CAC in 2951 African American and white young adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. Design: The present study was a cross-sectional and observational cohort study. Using standardized protocols, we measured CAC in 2001-2002 by using computed tomography and measured waist and hip girths in 1985-1986 (baseline), 1995-1996 (year 10), and 200 12002 (year 15, waist girth only). CAC was classified as present or absent, whereas waist girth and WHR were placed in sex-specific tertiles. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, race, clinical center, physical activity, cigarette smoking, education, and alcohol intake, baseline waist girth and WHR were directly associated with a higher prevalence of CAC 15 y later (P for trend < 0.001 for both). The odds ratios (ORs) for CAC in the highest versus lowest tertiles of waist girth and WHR were 1.9 (95% CI: 1.36, 2.65) and 1.7 (1.23, 2.41), respectively. Waist girth and WHR at year 10 and waist girth at year 15 similarly predicted CAC. These associations persisted after additional adjustment for systolic blood pressure, fasting insulin concentrations, diabetes, and antihypertensive medication use but became nonsignificant after additional adjustment for blood lipids. Conclusions: Abdominal obesity measured by waist girth or WHR is associated with early atherosclerosis as measured by the presence of CAC in African American and white young adults.

There is currently no satisfactory explanation for the relation of uric acid and the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn). This study aimed to evaluate the relations of change in serum uric acid with changes in components of the MetSyn in young adults. We studied 1,249 male and 1,362 female black and white subjects aged 17-35 years (baseline) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, which attended a 10-year follow-up. Metabolic factors assessed at both time periods included BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin, and lipids. Confounders examined (baseline and change variables) were serum creatinine, alcohol, smoking, physical activity, and oral contraceptives. Mean uric acid increased the most in black males (+0.5 mg/dl), followed by white males (+0.3 mg/dl) and black females (+0.2 mg/dl) (all P < 0.01), with the least change among white females (+0.1 mg/dl) (ns). Although change in all of the metabolic factors was associated with change in uric acid in the anticipated directions, in multivariable analyses only BMI and triglycerides had a significant independent association with uric acid in all race-sex-groups. Among confounders, only change in serum creatinine showed a strong independent association with uric acid. In conclusion, besides weight gain and renal excretion, increasing uric acid concentrations in young adults are strongly related to corresponding changes in triglycerides.

We found evidence of population sub-structure and excess inter-marker linkage disequilibrium, consistent with recent admixture. The estimated group admixture proportions were 78.1% African and 22.9% European, but differed according to geographic region. In multiple regression models, African ancestry was significantly associated with decreased total cholesterol, decreased LDL-cholesterol, and decreased triglycerides, and also with increased risk of insulin resistance. These observed associations between African ancestry and several lipid traits are consistent with the general tendency of individuals of African descent to have healthier lipid profiles compared to European-Americans.

Background Few studies have used multiple measures over the course of time to predict subclinical atherosclerosis. Methods African American and white adults, ages 18 to 30 years, in 4 U.S. cities were enrolled in the prospective CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study from 1985 to 1986. Risk factors were measured at years 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15, and CAC was assessed at year 15 (n = 3,043). Results Overall, 9.6% adults had any CAC, with a greater prevalence among men than women (15.0% vs. 5.1%), white than African American men (17.6% vs. 11.3%), and ages 40 to 45 years than 33 to 39 years (13.3% vs. 5.5%). Baseline levels predicted CAC presence (C = 0.79) equally as well as average 15-year levels (C = 0.79; p = 0.8262) and better than concurrent levels (C = 0.77; p = 0.019), despite a 15-year change in risk factor levels. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios of having CAC by ages 33 to 45 years were 1.5 (95% confidence interval [Cl] 1.3 to 1.7) per 10 cigarettes, 1.5 (95% Cl 1.3 to 1.8) per 30 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 1.3 (95% Cl 1.1 to 1.5) per 10 mm Hg systolic blood pressure, and 1.2 (95% Cl 1.1 to 1.4) per 15 mg,/dl glucose at baseline.

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), by competing with L-arginine, inhibits NO production and may lead to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic development. Our aim was to ascertain the association between ADMA and coronary artery calcification (CAC), a marker of atherosclerotic coronary disease burden. Design A nested case-control study within the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort, an observational study among young adults residing in four US cities. Methods Participants were 263 white and black male and female cases with the presence of CAC and 263 sex and race-matched controls without evidence of CAC by, computed tomography, 33-47 years old in 2000-2001.

Objective: The aim was to compare the associations of restaurant food and fast food consumption with current and 3-y changes in BMI. Design: Multivariate linear regression models, with control for demographic and lifestyle factors, were used to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of away-from-home eating with BMI by using data from subjects of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (n = 3394) obtained at exam years 7 (1992-1993) and 10 (1995-1996). Results: Forty percent of the sample increased their weekly consumption of restaurant or fast food, though mean ( +/- SD) changes were -0.16 +/- 2.39 times/wk (P = 0.0001) and -0.56 +/- 3.04 times/wk (P < 0.0001), respectively. Cross-sectionally, fast food, but not restaurant food, consumption was positively associated with BMI. Similarly, higher consumption of fast food at year 7 was associated with a 0.16-unit higher BMI at year 10. After adjustment for baseline away-from-home eating, increased consumption of fast food only (beta: 0.20; 95% Cl: 0.0 1, 0.39) and of both restaurant food and fast food (beta: 0.29; 95% Cl: 0.06, 0.51) were positively associated with BMI change, though the estimates were not significantly different (P = 0.47). Increased consumption of restaurant food only was unrelated to BMI change (beta: -0.01; 95% Cl: -0.21, 0.19), which differed significantly (P = 0.014) from the estimate for an increase in both restaurant food and fast food intake.

Methods: We assessed associations between F7 haplotypes and cardiovascular risk in two US population-based studies: a case-control study of these alleles related to a decreased risk of arterial thrombotic outcomes such as myocardial infarction (MI) in young-to-middle-aged women (n = 671), and a cohort study of cardiovascular disease risk factors in young women (n = 1040). Results: The high-expression F7 haplotype B (containing the promoter variant allele -402A) was associated with an increased FVII level among controls, but not with MI risk. Women carrying a >= 1 copy of the low FVII expression level haplotype C (containing the -401T/-323del/-122C and Gln353 alleles) had decreased FVII levels and decreased risk of MI (odds ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.93) compared with women homozygous for the most common haplotype A. Haplotype C was also associated with a decreased body mass index (BMI) and an increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, but not with MI risk after adjustment for these metabolic risk factors. In a cohort study composed of young US women, individuals homozygous for haplotype C had a lower BMI and lower systolic blood pressure, but the association between the F7 haplotype and HDL cholesterol was not confirmed.

Methods: We prospectively measured incidence and antecedents of nonmedical prescription opioid use in The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study among 28-40-year-old African- and European-American men and women with no prior history of nonmedical opioid use. Results: Among 3163 participants, 23 reported new nonmedical prescription opioid use in 2000-2001 (5-year incidence 0.7%; 95%CI: 0.4-1.0%). All 23 had previously reported marijuana use (p < 0.001). Five-year incidence was significantly higher among European-American men (OR=3.3; 95%CI: 1.3-8.3), and among participants reporting a history of amphetamine use (OR=24; 95%Cl: 6.9-83) or medical opioid use for treatment of pain (OR=8.6; 95%Cl: 2.5-30). These associations remained strong when examined among marijuana users and after adjusting for demographics, social factors, and other antecedent substance use. Amphetamine use was the best single predictor of future nonmedical use (sensitivity 87%, specificity 79%). Conclusions: Initiation of nonmedical prescription opioid use is generally rare in 28-40-year-old adults, but is observed to be more common with a previous history of substance abuse and legal access to opioids through prescription by a physician.

Nine polymorphisms, selected based on race-specific pairwise linkage disequilibrium relations and/or potential functional relevance, were assayed in 3,875 African-American and white young adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. These polymorphisms were C25819G (C-681G), C65746G (Pro12Ala), G67222A, A69208G, G81556T, T95872C, T115432G, C127599T, and C148157T (C1431T). They defined seven and six common haplotypes in African-Americans and whites, respectively. Patterns of associations of PPAR gamma genetic variation with the metabolic traits differed between the two racial groups, with some exceptions. Haplotype CCGGCTCC was associated with a significant reduction in glucose levels in both racial groups (P < 0.001 in each group), and the G69208 allele was associated with lower glucose levels in lean African-Americans and in whites (both P=0.02). Two haplotypes, relatively unique to whites, were associated with measures of adiposity and glucose levels. Two haplotypes, relatively unique to African-Americans, were associated with glucose levels. There were no significant effects of PPAR gamma haplotypes on measures of body size in this racial group, but a novel polymorphism, G67222A, significantly modulated the relation between BMI and glucose levels (P interaction, 0.003). This study provides evidence that variants, other than Pro12Ala, influence variation in body size and indices of insulin action. It underscores the role of genetic and environmental contexts in shaping the patterns of associations of PPAR gamma sequence variants with metabolic traits in human populations.",14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0946-2716,1432-1440,J MOL MED,J.

This strategy often succeeds when phenotypic differences are caused by one or two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the surveyed markers. However, when multiple-SNP haplotypes account for observed phenotypic variation, identification of the best partitioning requires examination of an inordinate number of SNP combinations. An alternative approach is to rank individuals by their phenotypic measures and ask whether attributes of the genotypic variation show a non-random distribution along this phenotypic ranking. One simple version of this strategy selects the top and bottom tails of the distribution, and then tests whether genotypes from these two samples are drawn from a single population. This framework does not require the recovery of phased haplotypes and allows contrasts between large numbers of sites at once. We use a method based on this approach to identify associations between plasma triglyceride level, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and multi-site genotypes located in the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 cluster of apolipoprotein genes in unrelated individuals (1,071 African-American females, 780 African-American males, 1,036 European-American females, and 930 European-American males) sampled from four US cities as part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study Method performance is investigated using simulations that model genealogical variation and different genetic architectures.

Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States, but its long-term effects on body mass index (BMI) and cardiovascular risk factors are unknown. Using 15 years of longitudinal data from 3,617 black and white young adults participating in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, we assessed whether marijuana use was associated with caloric intake, BMI, and cardiovascular risk factors. Of the 3,617 participants, 1,365 (38%) reported ever using marijuana. Marijuana use was'associated with male gender, tobacco smoking, and other illicit drug use. More extensive marijuana use was associated with a higher caloric intake (2,746 kcal/day in never users to 3,365 kcal/day in those who used marijuana for >= 1,800 days over 15 years) and alcohol intake (3.6 to 10.8 drinks/week), systolic blood pressure (112.7 to 116.5 mm Hg), and triglyceride levels (84 to 100 mg/dl or 0.95 to 1.13 mmol/L, all p values for trend < 0.001), but not with higher BMI and lipid and glucose levels. In multivariate analysis, the associations between marijuana use and systolic blood pressure and triglycerides disappeared, having been mainly confounded by greater alcohol use in marijuana users. In conclusion, although marijuana use was not independently associated with cardiovascular risk factors, it was associated with other unhealthy behaviors, such as high caloric diet, tobacco smoking, and other illicit drug use, which all have long-term detrimental effects on health.

Methods: We characterized the linkage disequilibrium patterns and haplotype structure across the human fibrinogen gene locus in European- and African-American populations. We analyzed the association between common polymorphisms in the fibrinogen genes and circulating levels of both 'functional' fibrinogen (measured by the Clauss clotting rate method) and total fibrinogen (measured by immunonephelometry) in a large, multi-center, bi-racial cohort of young US adults. Results: A common haplotype tagged by the A minor allele of the well-studied FGB-455 G/A promoter polymorphism (FGB 1437) was confirmed to be strongly associated with increased plasma fibrinogen levels. Two non-coding variants specific to African-American chromosomes, FGA 3845 A and FGG 5729 G, were each associated with lower plasma fibrinogen levels. In European-Americans, a common haplotype tagged by FGA Thr312Ala and several other variant alleles across the fibrinogen gene locus was strongly associated with decreased fibrinogen levels as measured by functional assay, but not by immunoassay. Overall, common polymorphisms within the three fibrinogen genes explain < 2% of the variability in plasma fibrinogen concentration. Conclusions: In young adults, fibrinogen multi-locus genotypes are associated with plasma fibrinogen levels. The specific single nucleotide polymorphism and haplotype patterns for these associations differ according to population and also according to phenotypic assay.

Design, Setting, and Participants A population-based, prospective, observational study ( Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults [ CARDIA]) of 2913 eligible participants (44.9% black; 53.9% women) recruited from 4 metropolitan areas ( Birmingham, Ala; Chicago, Ill; Minneapolis, Minn; and Oakland, Calif) in both the baseline (1985-1986, ages 18-30 years) and year 15 examinations (2000-2001, ages 33-45 years). Education ( year 15) was classified into less than high school (n= 128), high school graduate ( n= 498), some college ( n= 902), college graduate ( n= 764), and more than college ( n= 621). Main Outcome Measure Presence of CAC, measured twice by computed tomography ( mean total Agatston score > 0) at year 15. Results Overall CAC prevalence in this sample was 9.3%. After adjusting for age, race, and sex, the odds ratios (ORs) for having CAC were 4.14 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.33- 7.35) for less than high school education, 1.89 ( 95% CI, 1.23- 2.91) for high school graduate, 1.47 ( 95% CI, 0.99-2.19) for some college, and 1.24 ( 95% CI, 0.84-1.85) for college graduate compared with those participants with more than a college education ( P for trend <. 001). This was also consistent within each of the 4 race-sex groups. Adjustment for baseline systolic blood pressure, smoking, waist circumference, physical activity, and total cholesterol reduced the ORs to 2.61 ( 95% CI, 1.40-4.85) for less than high school, 1.38 ( 95% CI, 0.88-2.17) for high school graduate, 1.17 ( 95% CI, 0.78-1.77) for some college, and 1.13 ( 95% CI, 0.76-1.69) for college graduate compared with more than a college education ( P for trend=. 01), and only slightly attenuated by further adjustment for 15-year changes in risk factors.

Evidence that demonstrates the harmful effect of cigarette smoking during young adulthood is limited. Therefore, we assessed associations between cigarette smoking and several self-reported illnesses in a prospective cohort study in healthy young adults. Methods. Data were derived from 4472 adults aged 18 to 30 years at baseline participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study and reexamined at least once after 7, 10, or 15 years. Results. Cigarette smoking in 1985-86 was related to self-reported smoking-related cancers, circulatory disease, and peptic ulcer. Incidence of these diseases was 9.3/1000 person years among current smokers vs. 4.5/1000 person years among never smokers with no exposure to passive smoke, relative risk (adjusted for race, sex, education, and center) 1.96 (1.42-2.70). Assuming causal relationships, 32% of these premature incidents were attributable to smoking. The relative risks of liver disease, migraine headache, depression, being ill the day before the examination, and chronic cough and phlegm production were also higher in smokers. Conclusions. Smokers aged 18-30 followed for 7 to 15 years reported an excess of both major and minor ailments related to earlier and current smoking. Thus, prevention, cessation, and avoiding passive smoking should remain strong goals among young people. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated the relationships of concentrations of adiponectin with oxidative stress and the major risk factors for and/or the presence of macrovascular disease. Research Methods and Procedures: Adiponectin was measured by radioimmunoassay in serum from 3045 fasting participants (ages 33 to 45) of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. Cross-sectional correlation of the concentrations of adiponectin with F-2-isoprostane concentrations (a marker of systemic oxidative damage), coronary artery calcification (CAC; an estimate of early macrovascular disease), and several macrovascular risk factors was analyzed. Results: F-2-isoprostanes and CAC were unrelated to adiponectin after minimal adjustment for gender, race, and center. After additional adjustment for insulin resistance and waist circumference and other macrovascular risk factors, adiponectin correlated positively with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p < 0.0001), F-2-isoprostanes (p < 0.0001), and CAC (less strongly, p < 0.01) and negatively with triglycerides (p < 0.0001) and C-reactive protein (marking inflammation, p = 0.01). Discussion: Although these data are consistent with reduced cardiovascular disease risk imparted by adiponectin, the higher circulating levels of adiponectin present with oxidative stress and CAC (adjusting for waist and insulin resistance) may indicate an enhanced adiponectin secretory response of adipose tissue to the metabolic environment present in the early development of macrovascular disease.

Methods: Seven hundred eighty-one subjects from a multisite sample representing both whites and blacks provided six saliva cortisol samples over the course of the day: at awakening, 45 minutes, 2.5 hours, 8 hours, and 12 hours after awakening, and at bedtime. Results: Both lower SES (education and income) and being black were associated with higher evening levels of cortisol. These relationships were independent of one another and SES associations with cortisol were similar across racial categories. The evidence was consistent with poorer health practices (primarily smoking), higher levels of depressive symptoms, poorer social networks and supports, and feelings of helplessness (low mastery) mediating the link between SES and cortisol. However, we found no evidence for psychosocial or behavioral mediation of the association between race and cortisol response. Conclusions: Lower SES was associated in a graded fashion with flatter diurnal rhythms as a result of less of a decline during the evening. This association occurred independent of race and the data were consistent with mediation by health practices, emotional and social factors. Blacks also showed a flatter rhythm at the end of the day.

Objective: The objective was to evaluate associations of dietary intake with the 15-y incidence of elevated blood pressure (EBP; ie, incident systolic BP >= 130 mm Hg, diastolic BP >= 85 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive medication). Design: Proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate relations of dietary intake at years 0 and 7 with the 15-y incidence of EBP in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study of 4304 participants aged 18-30 y at baseline.

Methods We sought to measure the association between cocaine exposure and coronary calcification, a marker for atherosclerosis, among participants in the CARDIA Study who received computed tomography scanning and answered questions about illicit drug use at the year 15 examination in 2000-2001. Results Among 3038 CARDIA participants (age 33-45 years, 55% women and 45% black), past cocaine exposure was reported by 35% and was more common among men, smokers, drinkers, and participants with less education. Powdered cocaine exposure was more common among whites, crack cocaine among blacks. Before adjustment, cocaine exposure was strongly associated with coronary calcification. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, family history, and habits, however, these associations disappeared: adjusted odds ratios for coronary calcification were 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.3) for 1 to 10, 1.2 (95% CI 0.8-1.7) for 11 to 99, and 1.0 (95% CI 0.6-1.6) for >= 100 lifetime episodes of cocaine use, in comparison with none.

Frequency of the Ala12 allele was 2.1% in African Americans and 12.8% in whites, consistent with previous reports. A generalized estimating equation method was used to simultaneously examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between the Pro12Ala polymorphism and the measures of adiposity and insulin sensitivity. The Pro12Ala polymorphism was significantly associated with mean 15-year levels of adiposity, but these associations were in opposite direction in the 2 racial groups. On average, African Americans carrying the Ala12 allele had a 1.1 kg/m(2) lower body mass index (BMI) (P =.02) and whites a 0.6 kg/m(2) higher BMI (P =.01),as compared to Pro 12 homozygotes. The Ala12 allele was also significantly associated with a decreased risk of incident insulin resistance syndrome in each race (OR = 0.44, P =.04 in African Americans; OR = 0.61, P =.01 in whites) and lower mean 15-year levels of fasting insulin (P =.02), glucose (P =.02), and homeostasis model assessment (P =.01) in African Americans but not in whites.

SES was measured by parental education level. financial hardship during the study, and the participant's education level by the end of the study. We studied growth patterns of seven biological risk factors for cardiovascular disease using a semi-parametric, class-mixture model to identify clusters, of individuals with distinct growth trajectories. Risk scores that summarize risk from all seven risk factors were created to reflect risk at baseline, longitudinal risk change over 10 years. and total accumulated risk. Multivariable regression was used to study their associations with SES within each race/gender group. We found tracking of all seven risk factors: in each case, the cluster with the highest baseline value maintained its position as the highest-risk cluster over the next 10 years. After adjustment for age, lifestyle, and healthcare access. SES was associated inversely with baseline risk score in women (black and white), with risk change score in all four race/gender groups, and with accumulated risk score in women (black and white) and in white men. Our findings suggest that individuals with high overall cardiovascular risk in midlife can be identified by their relatively higher values of risk factors in younger ages and that socioeconomic differences in cardiovascular risk start accumulating early in life.

We observed 127 deaths (annual mortality of 0.15%). Compared to white women, the rate ratio (95% confidence interval) of all-cause mortality was 9.3 (4.4, 19.4) among black men, 5.3 (2.5, 11.4) among white men and 2.7 (1.2, 6.1) among black women. The predominant causes of death, which also differed greatly by sex-race, were AIDS (28% of deaths), homicide (16%), unintentional injury (10%), suicide (7%), cancer (7%) and coronary disease (7%). The significant baseline predictors of all-cause mortality in multivariate analysis were male sex, black race, diabetes, self-reported liver and kidney disease, current cigarette smoking and low social support. Two other factors, self-reported thyroid disease and high hostility, were significant predictors in analyses adjusted for age, sex and race. In conclusion, we found striking differences in the rates and underlying cause of death across sex-race groups and several independent predictors of young adult mortality that have major implications for preventive medicine and social policies.

However, the effect of fast food on risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes has received little attention. We aimed to investigate the association between reported fast-food habits and changes in bodyweight and insulin resistance over a 15-year period in the USA. Methods Participants for the CARDIA study included 3031 young (age 18-30 years in 1985-86) black and white adults who were followed up with repeated dietary assessment. We used multiple linear regression models to investigate the association of frequency of fast-food restaurant visits (fast-food frequency) at baseline and follow-up with 15-year changes in bodyweight and the homoeostasis model (HOMA) for insulin resistance. Findings Fast-food frequency was lowest for white women (about 1.3 times per week) compared with the other ethnic-sex groups (about twice a week). After adjustment for lifestyle factors, baseline fast-food frequency was directly associated with changes in bodyweight in both black (p=0.0050) and white people (p=0.0013). Change in fast-food frequency over 15 years was directly associated with changes in bodyweight in white individuals (p<0.0001), with a weaker association recorded in black people (p=0.1004). Changes were also directly associated with insulin resistance in both ethnic groups (p=0.0015 in black people, p<0.0001 in white people). By comparison with the average 15-year weight gain in participants with infrequent (less than once a week) fast-food restaurant use at baseline and follow-up (n=203), those with frequent (more than twice a week) visits to fast-food restaurants at baseline and follow-up (n=87) gained an extra 4.5 kg of bodyweight (p=0.0054) and had a two-fold greater increase in insulin resistance (p=0.0083).

This study investigates the association between coronary artery calcification (CAC) and parental history of stroke and MI in African-Americans and Caucasians from the CARDIA study. Methods Parental history of stroke and MI was determined by self-administered family history questionnaire at baseline and Year 5 examinations. Presence of coronary calcification was determined by computed tomography on 3041 individuals, age 32 to 47, including 1375 African -Americans and 1666 Caucasians. Analyses were restricted to individuals free of clinically manifest coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. Results Parental history of stroke is associated with a two-fold greater risk of CAC in African-Americans, and this relationship is independent from established CHD risk factors (95% 0=11.114-3.43). There is no relationship between parental history of stroke and CAC status in Caucasians. Parental history of MI is associated with a two-fold greater risk of CAC in Caucasians (95% CI=1.38-2.92). The impact of parental history of MI in African-Americans is lower (OR=1.65; 95% CI=1.01-2.69) and no longer statistically significant after adjusting for known CHD risk factors. Conclusions The identification of individuals with a parental history of stroke and MI provides important information for clinicians by which to target primary prevention efforts. Further characterization of familial factors, especially genetic factors, contributing to increased risk of CAC will shed light on the basis of the observed associations.

Purpose: We sought to determine whether changes in job strain during young adulthood were associated with the development of hypertension, using the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort. Methods: A total of 3,200 employed, initially normotensive participants, aged 20 to 32 in 1987-1988, were followed for 8 years; the Job Content Questionnaire was completed twice: initially and 8 years later. Hypertension at follow-up was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 160 or higher and diastolic blood pressure of 95 mmHg or higher or reporting being on antihypertensive medication. Results: Job strain (based on job demands above the median and decision latitude below the median of the sample) was associated with hypertension incidence (ps <.05) for the entire cohort and among White women and men. Adjustment for baseline SBP education, body mass index (BMI), change in BMI, and age did not alter these relations.

METHODS: Adiponectin in serum was measured by radioimmunoassay in 3355 participants (ages: 23-45 years) categorized by fasting glucose levels as normal, impaired fasting glucose, or diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Levels of adiponectin were higher in women, in white participants, and with age. Waist circumference, estimating visceral fat, strongly and inversely correlated with levels of adiponectin, more than body mass index. Adiponectin values adjusted for gender and race were lower with higher fasting glucose values in the normal range and still lower with impaired fasting glucose and untreated diabetes mellitus, even further adjusting for waist circumference and fasting insulin levels (P < 0.0001). Gender- and race-adjusted adiponectin levels were inversely associated with insulin resistance at year 15 and with insulin resistance measured 15 years previously and with its change from baseline to year 15 (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest complex and significant physiologic interactions among circulating levels of adiponectin and measures of insulin action throughout young adulthood, even from several years earlier. Central obesity, as measured with waist circumference, is a primary factor affecting levels of circulating adiponectin. Furthermore, levels of glucose and levels of adiponectin may directly influence one another. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Objective: We examined dietary correlates of serum GGT activity. Design: Study subjects were 3146 black and white men and women aged 17-35 y in 1985-1986. A diet history was taken at years 0 and 7. Food items were classified into alcohol; breaded, battered, or canned vegetables; fruit; fruit juice; refined grain; whole grain; dairy; legumes; meat; poultry; fish; fresh or frozen vegetables; nuts; and coffee. Results: After adjustment for nondietary factors and other food groups, GGT was positively, associated with alcohol consumption and meat intake. Geometric means of year 10 GGT across categories of alcohol consumption (0, 1-9, 10-19, 20-29, and greater than or equal to 30 g/d) were 17.7, 18.8, 20.4, 21.8, and 24.8 U/L (P for trend < 0.01); corresponding means across quintiles of meat intake were 19.2, 20.2, 20.5, 21.8, and 21.2 times/wk (P for trend < 0.01). GGT was inversely associated with fruit intake. Among possible meat constituents, dietary heme iron, but not saturated fat, was associated with GGT. Dietary constituents typical of plant foods showed an inverse association. In contrast, vitamin supplements were positively associated with GGT. Conclusions: Serum GGT activity increased in a dose-response manner as alcohol and meat consumption increased and fruit consumption decreased.

CARDIA is a longitudinal cohort study of 2,778 black and white men and women initially 18-30 years old. Diet was assessed at years 0 and 7 by an extensive diet history and plasma lipids were also measured. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine concurrent change in plasma lipid levels and change in dairy food intake.

After correction for within-person error in dietary assessment, the true mean increase in LDL-C from lowest to highest quintile of change in dairy food intake was estimated to be 3-6 times larger, about 10-18 mg/dL. Neither change in HDL-C nor TG was associated with change in dairy food intake among consumers, but consumers of low-fat milk had lower HDL-C (change was about 1 mg/dL less than the HDL-C change in non-consumers, p=0.04), while the HDL-C was higher among consumers of butter and cream (p=0.02).

BACKGROUND Left ventricular mass is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. METHODS Two-dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiograms were used to calculate LV mass index (g/height(2.7)) and geometry. RESULTS Black men had highest LV mass index followed by white men, black women, and white women. Blacks had higher LV wall thickness/diameter ratios than whites. Left ventricular hypertrophy was present in 2% of the cohort. Going from highest to lowest quartile for LV mass index and LV wall thickness/diameter ratio, SBP and BMI were highest in those with the highest LV mass index and LV wall thickness/diameter ratio. Increasing BMI and SBP over a 10-year interval was also strongly related to LV structure in most race/gender groups.

The CARDIA Male Hormone Study",CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS & PREVENTION,Article,"Serum testosterone concentration appears to be higher in black men than white men, particularly at younger ages. The higher incidence of prostate cancer in blacks has been attributed, at least in part, to this difference. Other factors associated with androgen levels in men include age and obesity. However, most of the studies of adult androgen levels are limited by their cross-sectional design. We conducted longitudinal analyses (Generalized Estimating Equation) of the associations of age, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference with total and free testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations during an 8-year period and compared these hormonal factors between black (n = 483) and white (n = 695) male participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. For men ages 24 years and older at the time of the first hormone measurement, increasing age was associated with a statistically significant decrease in serum total and free testosterone and an increase in SHBG (P < 0.05). BMI and waist circumference were inversely associated with total testosterone and SHBG, but only BMI was inversely associated with free testosterone. After adjustment for age and BMI, total testosterone was higher in blacks (0.21 ng/ml; P = 0.028) than whites, an approximately 3% difference. However, after further adjustment for waist circumference, there was no black-white difference (0.05 ng/ml; P = 0.62). These results indicate that the age-associated decrease in circulating testosterone and increase in SHBG begin during the 3rd decade of life, and that increasing obesity, particularly central obesity, is associated with decreasing total testosterone and SHBG. Results also suggest that the previously observed difference in total testosterone between black and white men could be attributed, for the most part, to racial differences in abdominal obesity.",172,AMER ASSOC CANCER RESEARCH,BIRMINGHAM,"PO BOX 11806, BIRMINGHAM, AL 35202 USA",1055-9965,,CANCER EPIDEM BIOMAR,Cancer Epidemiol.

Initial systolic blood pressure (SBP) was a significant predictor of year 10 LV mass in white men and black women; change in SBP was significant in black women with a trend towards significance in white women. Left ventricular mass remained constant in all race/gender subgroups, except black women, where it increased (by 5.9 g [mean]). Black women also had the largest increases in BMI and SBP. In black women, a five-year weight gain of 20 pounds and a 15-mm Hg increase in SBP would be expected to be associated with a 9% to 12% increase in LV mass. CONCLUSIONS Particularly in black women, weight and blood pressure control may be important community health and treatment goals to prevent LV hypertrophy.

Little information is available on RMR in African-American men. Research Methods and Procedures: We assessed RMR by indirect calorimetry and body composition by DXA in 395 adults ages 28 to 40 years (100 African-American men, 95 white men, 94 African-American women, and 106 white women), recruited from participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), Birmingham, Alabama, and Oakland, California, field centers. Results: Using linear models, fat-free mass, fat mass, visceral fat, and age were significantly related to RMR, but the usual level of physical activity was not. After adjustment for these variables, mean RMR was significantly higher in whites (1665.07 +/- 10.78 kcal/d) than in African Americans (1585.05 +/- 11.02 kcal/d) by 80 +/- 16 kcal/d (p < 0.0001).

Discussion: RMR is similar to5% higher in white than in African-American participants in CARDIA. The difference was the same for men and women and for lean and obese individuals. The prevalence of obesity is not higher in African-American men than in white men.

We measured forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in 1985-1986 and 2, 5, and 10 years later in approximately 4,000 black and white men and women initially aged 18-30 years. We estimated the age pattern of FEV1 according to family smoking status, early diagnosis of asthma, early smoking initiation, adult asthma, and cigarette smoking. FEV1 followed a quadratic pattern from age of peak through age 40. The pattern varied by race and sex. Early smoking initiation was associated with a faster decrease in FEV1. Smoking by family members was related to early life asthma and may have contributed to faster FEV1 decrease by encouraging behaviors such as heavier smoking or earlier smoking initiation. Prevalence of smoking was 28% when no family member smoked, compared with 59% when four or more members smoked. The FEV1 decline was 8.5% in never-smokers without asthma; 10.1% in nonsmoking individuals diagnosed with asthma; and 11.1% in baseline smokers who smoked 15 or more cigarettes per day. The combination of asthma and heavier smoking was synergistic (17.8% decline).

Methods: Changes in measures of smoking, physical activity, lipids/lipoproteins, body weight, and blood pressure were investigated over two consecutive 5-year follow-up periods among 3950 participants (aged 18 to 30 years) in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, who either did or did not have all immediate family member experience a heart attack or stroke. Recruitment and examinations for Years 0, 5, and 10 took place in 1985-1986, 1990-1991, and 1995-1996, respectively. Results: After adjustment for baseline demographics and risk factors, young adults who experienced a change in family history of heart attack or stroke over a 5-year period were no more likely than those who did not to quit smoking, or to experience more positive changes in weight, physical activity, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, or systolic or diastolic blood pressure. These findings persisted among the few study participants with one or more established risk factors at baseline. Conclusions: The occurrence of a heart attack or stroke in an immediate family member does not appear to lead to self-initiated, sustained change in modifiable risk factors in young adults. Since family history of heart attack and stroke is associated with known risk factors and is all independent risk factor for incident development of these conditions, interventions should be developed and tested to motivate sustained risk-factor control following occurrence of a severe vascular event in a family member.",27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0749-3797,,AM J PREV MED,Am.

Spine, hip and whole body BMDs were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) when the women were aged 25-37 years, and whole body BMD was remeasured in 369 of the women 3 years later. A comprehensive history of OC use, including dose of ethinyl estradiol (estrogen) and duration of use, was determined from an interviewer-administered questionnaire. After adjustment for other relevant variables, we found that cumulative estrogen from OCs (mg) explained 4.0% of the variation in spine BMD (p = 0.024) among white women, but did not explain any of the variance in BMD in black women. Cumulative OC estrogen was associated with a decreased risk for low bone density (lowest quartile) at the spine, hip and whole body in white women. The odds ratios (95% CIs) comparing women in the highest quartile of cumulative OC estrogen with those in the lowest quartile were, at the spine: 0.08 (0.02, 0.46); at the hip: 0.23 (0.06, 0.87); and at the whole body: 0.37 (0.11, 1.26). OC exposure was not related to low bone density in black women. OCs did not predict longitudinal changes in whole body BMD in either race. These results suggest that exposure to the estrogen from OCs during the premenopausal years may have a small beneficial effect on the skeleton in white women. Benefit is proportional to the cumulative estrogen exposure, suggesting that previous cross-sectional studies that considered OC use as a dichotomous variable may have lacked the power to detect an association.",23,SPRINGER-VERLAG LONDON LTD,GODALMING,"SWEETAPPLE HOUSE CATTESHALL ROAD, GODALMING GU7 3DJ, SURREY, ENGLAND",0937-941X,,OSTEOPOROSIS INT,Osteoporosis Int.,,2002,13,11,893,900,,10.1007/s001980200123,8,Endocrinology & Metabolism,Endocrinology & Metabolism,WOS:000179554500007,12415437,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study investigated whether high social support was associated with better health behavior than low social support in individuals with high hostility scores. Methods: The subjects were 5115 healthy black and white men and women ranging in age from 18 to 30 years. The hypothesis was that the association between hostility and certain adverse health behaviors would be diminished in the presence of high social support. Race-gender specific median cutpoints of the Cook-Medley Hostility scale and an index of social support defined levels of high and low hostility and social support. Results: After controlling for age and body mass index (BMI), support was positively associated with more exercise in all groups except black women, but when coupled with high hostility, this positive association between support and exercise remained only in men. White women with high support were less often smokers but this association did not hold when examined only in the high-hostile group. Black men and white women with high support in the presence of high hostility consumed more alcohol, but the amount was moderate. Conclusions: We conclude that social support in the presence of high hostility only sometimes reduces the association of hostility to adverse health behaviors and that these effects are complex.

Also, to explore the interactive and independent relative contributions of Apo E phenotype, fitness (or physical activity), and other modifiable factors to variation in plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) levels at baseline and over a seven-year follow-up. METHODS: Physical fitness (duration of a graded treadmill test), ADo E phenotype, plasma LLL-C and HDL-C, and covariates were measured at baseline and seven years later in a bi racial cohort of young adults, aged 18-30 years at baseline in 1985-86 (N = 3629), from the Coronary Artery Risk Development In Young Adults (CARDIA) study. RESULTS: Fitness did not influence the associations of Apo E and LDL-C or HDL-C. The independent effects of several modifiable variables (changes in Keys' score, smoking, oral contraceptive use, education, body weight, alcohol intake, and fitness), when combined, contributed considerably more than Apo E to the variance in LDL-C changes (6.74% or 8.71% for combined modifiable variables vs. 1.27% or 0.90% for ApoE, in women or men, respectively) and HDL-C changes (13.11% or 12.66% fur combined modifiable variables vs. 0.12% or 0.02% for ApoE, in women or men, respectively). The pattern of findings was similar when self reported physical activity was substituted for fitness. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in modifiable factors, including fitness, may be stronger correlates of changes in LDL-C and HDL-C over time than the immutable factor, Apo E phenotype.

The present study examined whether the TNF2 allele was associated with altered levels of different components of the insulin resistance syndrome, clustering of these components, or the 10-year change in the level of these components. Methods: Components of the insulin resistance syndrome included insulin resistance, as determined by fasting insulin levels, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, uric acid, and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol.

Results: The frequency of the TNF2 allele was 12% in blacks and 16% in whites. Age-adjusted levels of the different components examined were not different at either baseline or year 10 in carriers of the TNF2 allele versus homozygotes for the wild-type allele, and the 10-year change In the level of different components was not different between the two genotype groups. There also was no evidence of increased clustering of components of the insulin resistance syndrome in carriers of the TNF2 allele. Moreover, there was no evidence of an association between the TNF2 allele and clustering across quartiles of BMI or quartiles of dietary fat intake (ie, Key's score).

Results: In regression models with total adiposity measures (body mass index or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-measured percent fat), visceral AT (measured as a cross-sectional area in cm(2)) was generally a stronger predictor of insulin than overall adiposity in all race/gender groups (partial correlation coefficients ranging from 0.31 to 0.47) except for black men, in whom the associations were nonsignificant.

Mean plasma cholesterol was 14 mg/dl higher in 27- than in 20-year-old black men cross-sectionally, but longitudinally it declined by 4 mg/dl during the 7 years. To sort out these contradictory assessments of the effect of age/passage of time, we estimated age and period effects under the assumptions that age effects are a smooth function of age independent of period, and that period effects are changes common to persons across all ages. Simple estimates the age effect, such as the cross-sectional age slopes, may be confounded by cohort effects, by interactions of time and age after baseline, or by the occurrence of non-linearities in response after baseline. We note examples of each potential type of bias. The data and background literature support the assumption that cohort effects do not seriously compromise interpretation for these variables in the CARDIA study. Strong secular decreases in plasma cholesterol apparently due to population-wide dietary change, mask increases with ageing. Age increases in triglycerides are largely explained by increases in body fatness. For these data, we cautiously accept the cross-sectionl age slope as an estimate of ageing and the age-matched time trend as an estimate of secular trend.

VAT can be accurately assessed by computed topography or magnetic resonance imaging, but is also estimated from anthropometric variables, such as waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, or sagittal diameter. To date, anthropometric variables have been used largely in whites and inadequate data are available to evaluate the validity of these variables in other groups. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to 1) determine whether amount of VAT in relation to total body fatness differs in different race and sex groups and 2) determine which anthropometric variables predict amount of VAT in different race and sex groups. Design: We determined the amount and location of body fat, including assessment of VAT by computed tomography, in young adult white and black men and women participating in the 10-y follow-up of the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) Study. Results: Black men had less visceral fat (73.1 +/- 35.9 cm(2)) than white men (99.3 +/- 40 cm(2)), even when VAT was corrected for total body fatness. Black women were more obese than white women and thus had more visceral fat (75.1 +/- 37.5 compared with 58.6 +/- 35.9 cm(2), respectively). This difference disappeared when corrected for total body fatness. Conclusions: Both waist circumference and sagittal diameter were good predictors of VAT in all groups. However, the nature of this relation differed such that race- and sex-specific equations will likely be required to estimate VAT from waist circumference or sagittal diameter.",187,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0002-9165,1938-3207,AM J CLIN NUTR,Am.

METHODS: The participants in this observational study were the 1177 black and white men and women, ages 18-30 at entry into the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort, who completed a symptom-limited graded treadmill exercise test and had an overnight fasting blood draw at both the Baseline (1985-86) and Year 7 (1992-93) exams. CARDIA, a longitudinal study of the relationships of lifestyle and physiological variables to the development of coronary heart disease risk factors, consists of population based cohorts in Birmingham, Alabama, Minneapolis, Minnesota and Chicago, Illinois and a cohort recruited from the membership of a large, pre-paid health care plan, broadly representative of the population, in Oakland, California. RESULTS: All race/gender groups experienced mean decreases in physical fitness and self-reported physical activity and increases in weight. Decreased fitness was associated with decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and conversely, increased fitness was associated with increased HDL-C. The correlation coefficients of change in fitness with change in HDL-C ranged from 0.17 in white men and black women to 0.24 in white women (P < 0.001 for all race/gender groups). Change in fitness was minimally correlated with change in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in all groups (r ranged from -0.09 in black women to -0.20 in white women), triglycerides (TG) in men and white women (r ranged from -0.10 to -0.15), and total cholesterol (TC) in white men and women (r = -0.11 and -0.15, respectively). The magnitude of these correlations was further reduced with adjustment for weight change. Correlations between change in activity and change in lipid and lipoprotein Values were generally weak or nonexistent, except for the suggestion of a small, direct relationship with change in HDL-C in black and white women (r = 0.14 and r = 0.11, respectively). ALI of the weight change adjusted correlations were essentially unaffected by further adjustment for baseline fitness or activity and other covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased fitness during young adulthood is associated with unfavorable changes in lipid profile, explained mostly by increased weight. Lack of association between change in activity and change in lipid profile observed in this study may be due, in part, to imprecision of activity measurement.

Leptin, a peptide hormone expressed in adipose tissue, is believed to signal the central nervous system about the level of body fat stores, and thereby may control appetite. Little information exists on whether the serum leptin concentration influences long-term weight changes in the free-living population. Research Methods and Procedures: From an ongoing cohort study of young African American and white adults, we selected a sample of participants (n=492), stratified on sex, race, and weight changes over 8 years. Serum leptin was measured on stored specimens using a radioimmunoassay. Weight change was modeled in relation to baseline leptin concentrations. Results: Cross-sectionally, leptin concentration was associated positively with body mass index, negatively with physical activity level, and was higher in women than men. These variables explained 72% of the variance in serum leptin. Over the 8 years, the sample gained an average of 7.8 kg (standard deviation = 10.8). There was no evidence that 8-year weight change was associated with initial leptin concentration: 8-year weight change was only 0.5 kg less (95% confidence interval = -1.8 to 0.8, p = 0.47) per each 10 ng/mL increment (approximately one standard deviation) of baseline leptin. In contrast, leptin change correlated highly (r = 0.62) with weight change.

Data from 3,485 African-American and white men and women between the ages of 25 and 37 years who attended the fourth CARDIA Study examination in 1992-1993 were used in this analysis, African-American men and women had significantly higher frequencies of E2 and E4 phenotype and thus higher frequencies of *epsilon 2 and *epsilon 4 alleles (p < 0.005). Men and women of both races with APOE4 phenotype generally had higher low density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein(a) concentrations and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, and individuals with APOE3 phenotype had the lowest triglyceride concentration. Major differences between African Americans and whites were observed in the distribution of APOE phenotypes and YE alleles, but APOE phenotype was associated with similar differences in lipoprotein and apoprotein concentrations in both races.

This study examined associations between energy from dietary sucrose and HDL-C at baseline, year 7 and longitudinally (year 7 minus baseline) in a cohort of young black and white men and women from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. METHODS: The sample included 4734 black men, black women, white men and white women, ages 18-30 years, in 1985-86 (baseline); 3513 at year 7; and 3335 for longitudinal analyses. Multivariate analyses was used with adjustment for age, BMI, cigarettes smoked per day, physical activity score, and alcohol intake. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses indicated chat energy intake from sucrose was inversely associated with HDL-C for each race-gender group at baseline, year 7, and longitudinally from baseline to year 7. This association was significant at baseline for black men, and white men and women (p < 0.01); at year 7 for white men and black women (p < 0.01), and longitudinally for white men, white women, and black women (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The consistent inverse associations between energy from dietary sucrose and HDL-C observed in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, and in different race and gender groups in CARDIA suggest that lowering dietary sucrose intake may be beneficial for those who may have low HDL-C.

Methods: A cohort of 4,086 healthy young adults was followed from 1985-1986 through 1992-1993. Participants were recruited from four urban sites balanced on gender, race (African Americans and whites), education (high school or less, and more than high school), and age (18-23 and 24-30). Outcome measures were smoking status at Year 7, as well as 7-year rates of smoking cessation and initiation. Results: For each of three access barriers reported at Year 7 (lack of health insurance, lack of regular source of medical care, and expense), participants experiencing the barrier had a higher prevalence of smoking, quit smoking less frequently, and started smoking more frequently; e.g., only 15% of participants with health insurance lapses quit smoking over the 7-year period, compared with 26% of those with insurance (P < 0.001). Results were similar for each race/gender stratum, and persisted after adjustment for usual markers of socioeconomic status: education, income, employment, and marital status.

METHODS: Data on cigarette smoking have been collected for ten years (1986-1996) from 5115 black and white men and women, aged 18-30 years, participating in the Coronary Artery Risk Development In Young Adults (CARDIA) study, Regression analysis adjusting for intra-person correlation over time and weighting for factors affecting follow up was used to estimate change in smoking rates. RESULTS: Overall, smoking rates declined in white women (-0.50%/year, p < 0.001) and white men (-0.24%/year, p = 0.03). Rates remained stable in black women and increased in black men (0.37%/year, p = 0.01). Declining rates were generally observed in white women of all educational levels and birth cohorts and in several subgroups of white men. Increasing rates among black men could be attributed primarily to increasing rates in the youngest birth cohort. Among black men and women, prevalence of smoking in 1986 was considerably lower in the youngest birth cohort compared to the oldest; however, the increasing rates of change in smoking rates observed among the youngest birth cohorts (and decreasing rates in the oldest) lessened the disparity in prevalence rates across birth cohorts by 1996. Smoking initiation rates were highest among black men; cessation rates were highest among white women. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that declines in smoking prevalence are not occurring across all groups, and reveal populations in special need of targeted interventions, particularly young black men.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study in 4053 young black and white adults aged 18-30 years from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. RESULTS: Body mass index (BMI), fasting insulin, and triglycerides were significantly higher, and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol lower in subjects with hyperuricemia (uric acid greater than or equal to 7.0 mg/dl in males; greater than or equal to 6.0 mg/dl in females) (all p < 0.001). BMI showed the strongest positive correlation with uric acid among the IRS components. Significant associations of hyperuricemia with these risk factors were observed in all sex-race groups, which persisted after controlling for possible confounders including age, educations physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, oral contraceptive use, and creatinine. Further adjustment for BMI and/or waist-to-hip ratio caused a large decrease in the strength of the associations. Adjustment for insulin also lead, to decreases; however, the influence of fasting insulin appeared weaker than obesity. Even after controlling for obesity, insulin, and the other components of the IRS, male subjects in both races in the upper tertile of triglycerides were still more likely to have hyperuricemia. CONCLUSIONS: The association of hyperuricemia with most aspects of the IRS may result predominantly from their covariation with adiposity, and secondarily with insulin level. Elevated triglyceride level seems to have an independent relationship with hyperuricemia in males. The relationship between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular disease observed in previous studies may be secondary to its association with the IRS.

Corresponding values were, for white men, 0.852 to 0.831; for black women, 0.777 to 0.721; and for white women, 0.172 to 0.701 teach P < 0.0001). Reported fat distribution was associated with HDL-C in women, but not in men, and with fasting insulin in all groups. While these associations were somewhat weaker than with measured WHR, self-reported fat distribution does provide valid information about body fat distribution in young adults, particularly women.

In previous work, we found that urinary cGMP was inversely related to diastolic BP, but cGMP levels were higher among individuals presumed to have increased adrenergic activity, increased reactivity, and increased risk of hypertension (blacks, individuals with a family history of hypertension). Method: We measured 24-hour urinary cGMP levels in a substudy of 529 individuals in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study; the sample was 23 to 35 years of age and approximately balanced for race (black/white) and gender. BP reactivity to stressors (video game, star-tracing, cold presser) was tested 3 years earlier. Baseline BP was included as a covariate in all analyses. Results: Diastolic BP reactivity to cold presser was inversely related to cGMP excretion (p < .05); the relationship was strongest among black women with a family history of hypertension (partial r = -.33, p < .01). Systolic BP reactivity to star-tracing was also inversely related to cGMP (p < .01); the relationship for both star-tracing and video game stressors was strongest among black men (partial r values = -.25 and -.24, respectively; p values < .01).

The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the 7-yr change in physical fitness in a biracial (black and white) population of young men and women. Methods: We evaluated change in exercise treadmill test performance in a biracial (black and white) population of 1,962 young adults, ages 18-30 yr at baseline, who completed symptom-limited graded exercise treadmill tests at the baseline (1985-1986) and year 7 (1992-1993) examinations of the CARDIA study. Results: Mean test duration decreased 58 s (9.5%) over 7 yr (black men, 13.6% decrease, white men, 7.4%; black women, 11.1%; white women, 7.0%). Mean time to heart rate 130 (WL130), a measure of submaximal performance, decreased 31 s (11.3%) (black men, 16.9%; white men, 10.0%; black women, 12.3%; white women, 6.1%).

Method: A total of 3364 participants (910 white men, 909 white women, 678 black men, and 867 black women), initially 20 to 32 years old and normotensive, were included. Cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stressors (video game and star-tracing tasks for 3 minutes, cold presser test for 1 minute) was measured in 1987-1988. We then examined reactivity as a predictor of significant BP change (greater than or equal to 8 mm Hg, thought to represent a clinically significant increase) over the next 5 years. Logistic regression models were used to control for potential covariates. Significant BP change and the development of hypertension (BP greater than 140/90 or taking medication for hypertension) over the 5-year follow-up were examined in separate analyses. Results: Increased systolic blood pressure (SEP) reactivity to the video game was associated with a significant 5-year SEP increase among the entire cohere, independent of resting SEP (p<.0001). Subsequent analyses showed that this relationship held for men but not for women. Reactivity to the star-tracing task or the cold presser test did not predict significant BP change. Among black men only, new hypertensives (N = 36) had greater diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reactivity to the video game (p = .01). Conclusions: Although BP reactivity to all physical and mental stressors used in this study did not consistently predict 5-year change in BP in this young cohort, the results indicate that reactivity to a video game stressor predicts 5-year change in BP and early hypertension among young adult men. These findings are consistent with other studies showing the usefulness of stressors producing a primarily P-adrenergic response in predicting BP change and hypertension.

At both 7 and 10 years, approximately 8.5% of participants stated they had been ''ill with cold, flu, fever, or vomiting in the past 24 hours.''

The authors conclude that reductions in plasma total, low density, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol mark an acute phase response even during minor illness. These reductions may bias surveys over a limited geographic area during a short period because the proportion with minor illness may vary locally. Because this effect should be stronger with more precise illness diagnosis, clinicians should avoid making measurements for cholesterol management when illness may alter plasma lipid levels and resulting decisions.",21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9262,1476-6256,AM J EPIDEMIOL,Am.

These vasodilatory factors are important in blood pressure regulation and possibly in the etiology of hypertension, Urinary cGMP levels among normotensive young adults have not previously been studied, Subjects A subset of normotensive participants from the CARDIA study (n = 563), aged 23-35 years, was studied, The sample was approximately balanced for sex and race (black/white). Methods Twenty-four-hour urinary cGMP levels were measured using an enzyme immunoassay; levels were adjusted for creatinine excretion. The blood pressure, smoking status, and risk factors for hypertension [including a family history of hypertension (FHH), the body mass index, education, alcohol intake, and sodium excretion] were also measured. Results Women excreted more cGMP than did men, and blacks excreted more cGMP than did whites (both P< 0.0001). Excretion of cGMP was also greater among smokers (P < 0.001) and those with an FHH (P= 0.05), and was related directly and independently to sodium excretion (P < 0.02). The diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was related inversely to the excretion of cGMP among individuals without an FHH (r = -0.36, P< 0.001), but not among individuals with an FHH. In multiple regression analysis, the excretion of cGMP remained related significantly to the DBP and accounted for more variance in DBP than did any other variable among those without an FHH (Delta R-2 = 0.08, P< 0.001). Conclusions Urinary cGMP excretion is related inversely and independently to the DBP among those without an FHH but not among those with an FHH, suggesting that cGMP-related vasodilatation is impaired in those with an FHH, Sex differences in urinary excretion of cGMP are consistent with results from studies showing that estrogen increases the endothelial production of nitric oxide.",9,RAPID SCIENCE PUBLISHERS,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8NH",0263-6352,,J HYPERTENS,J.

Data on stability of plasma total cholesterol levels and its determinants among young adults are lacking, Knowledge of factors associated with low levels of plasma total cholesterol during young adulthood may help clarify the nature of associations between hypocholesterolemia and health or illness, Methods. Tracking of plasma total cholesterol was investigated using data from the baseline (1985-1986), Year 5 (1990-1991), and Year 7 (1992-1993) examinations of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. Lifestyle (including dietary), physiological, medical, and psychological correlates of plasma total cholesterol were examined cross-sectionally at baseline using ANCOVA and multivariate logistic regression. The attributes of participants with persistently low plasma total cholesterol level after 7 years (i.e., remaining below the 10th percentile of sex- and race-specific distributions) were also examined. Results. The cohort in this analysis comprised 720 black men, 922 white men, 899 black women, and 944 white women who were between the ages of 18 and 30 years at baseline, Between 44 and 52% of those with plasma total cholesterol levels below the 10th percentile remained below the same percentile 7 years later, Among black men, a difference of 1 SD in age [3.7 years; odds ratio (OR) = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.52-0.91] and a difference of 1 SD in systolic blood pressure (10.5 mm Hg; OR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.54-0.97) were independently associated with lower odds, respectively, of being in the lowest 10th percentile of the plasma total cholesterol distribution. Also among black men, current smoking and more calories from carbohydrates were associated with nonsignificantly higher odds of low total cholesterol level. Among white men, a 1 SD older age (3.4 years; OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.61-1.00) and a 1 SD higher physical fitness (118 sec; OR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.09-1.82) predicted lower and higher odds, respectively, of low plasma total cholesterol. Among black women, a 1 SD difference in albumin (0.3 g/dL; OR = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.63-1.03) was related to lower odds of low plasma total cholesterol. Among white women, the factors independently associated with low plasma total cholesterol were body mass index (OR for a difference in 4.0 kg/m(2) = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.54-1.00) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (OR for an increase in 9.6 IU/L = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.18-0.93), The independent predictive factors of stably low total cholesterol levels were age and uric acid among black men (both inversely related) and age, Framingham Type A Behavior (inversely), and calories from carbohydrates (positively related) among white men. Conclusion: Young adults with low plasma total cholesterol level have characteristics generally associated with good cardiovascular health. However, adverse attributes such as current cigarette smoking (notably among black men) may confound future associations between low total cholesterol and disease.

To determine whether changes in VIIc parallel changes in coronary risk factors over a period of 2 years, we examined data from 1514 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA), an ongoing investigation of lifestyles and evolution of cardiovascular risk factors. Subjects were 23 to 35 years old at the year 5 examination. Cross-sectional analyses at these examinations showed that VIIc was positively correlated (P<.001) with TC and TG in all race/sex groups except for TC in black women at the year 5 examination. Changes in VIIc over the 2-year period were correlated positively with changes in TC in all except black men and TG in all groups; the association of VIIc change with change in TC and TG was reduced only slightly with adjustment for age and BMI at year 5 and 2-year change in BMI. To determine whether the higher levels of VIIc in subjects with higher lipid values were due to activation of the factor or to an increase in the concentration of the factor VII clotting protein, we measured factor VII antigen (VIIag) in a randomly selected subsample of 223 subjects at the year 7 examination. In all sex/race groups, VIIag correlated with VIIc (r=.69 to 0.81). After adjustment for sex and race, the partial correlation coefficient between TG and VIIc was .28 (P=.0001); between TG and VIIag, .35 (P=.0001); between TC and VIIc, .39 (P=.0001); and between TC and VIIag, 0.43 (P=.0001). No associations were observed between lipid levels and the ratio of VIIc to VIIag. We conclude that the raised VIIc with higher lipid levels occurs in blacks as well as whites, in men and women, persists over time, and represents a true increase in the plasma concentration of this clotting factor.",22,AMER HEART ASSOC,DALLAS,"7272 GREENVILLE AVENUE, DALLAS, TX 75231-4596",1079-5642,,ARTERIOSCL THROM VAS,Arterioscler.

Plasma Lp[a] analyses were performed by an ELISA method insensitive to apo[a] size heterogeneity and apo[a] size isoforms were determined by high resolution agarose gel electrophoresis. Allele frequencies were estimated by maximum likelihood methods in order to account for the presence of null alleles and coalescence of bands on gels. The apo[a] allele frequencies and phenotype distributions differed significantly between blacks and whites (P < 0.0001). Blacks had a higher relative frequency of the intermediate alleles K4(22) through K4(28) whereas whites had a higher relative frequency of the small alleles K4(17) through K4(24) and large alleles K4(29) through K4(33). The estimated frequency of the null allele was low in both blacks (1.0%) and whites (6.7%). The Lp[a] distribution was less skewed and Lp[a] concentrations were higher in blacks than whites (mean 94 nmol/L and 48 nmol/L, median 74 nmol/L and 20 nmol/L for blacks and whites, respectively). The relationship between apo[a] size and Lp [a] concentration also differed significantly between these hyo racial groups. For the large polymorphs (>31 K4 repeats) both blacks and whites exhibited uniformly low Lp[a] values. For the intermediate isoforms K4(20) through K4(30), a considerable range of Lp[a] values was evident in blacks; the median Lp[a] for each isoform increased nearly linearly as the apo[a] size decreased. In contrast, in whites there was little change in median Lp[a] concentrations for isoforms K4(20) through K4(30). For the small apo[a] size (<20 K4) both blacks and whites exhibited high median Lp[a] lev els and a nide variation of Lp[a] levels. The major difference in Lp[a] levels between the two racial groups occurred in the intermediate size isoform range of K4(20) through K4(25). In conclusion, whites and blacks differ significantly in Lp[a] concentrations, allele and phenotype frequencies, and in the relationship between apo[a] size isoform and Lp[a] concentration.-Marcovina, S.M., J.J.

Primary analyses were performed within race/gender subgroups and were supplemented with analyses examining consistency of associations across these groups. After controlling for age, high density lipoprotein (HDL) decreased, triglycerides increased, low density lipoprotein (LDL) increased, and the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio increased with increasing level of education in black men. This pattern is, in general, opposite to that found in other groups, particularly white women, whose lipid profile was found to be less atherogenic the higher the education. These associations were strongly confounded with health behaviors. There was also a positive association between hostility and triglycerides in women but not in men. No significant association with any plasma lipid for either race or gender was found for Type A behavior, social support, of life events. Despite a narrow plasma lipid range in these young adults, these data support the conclusion that increasing education is associated with a less atherogenic plasma lipid profile, except in black men, for whom education is associated with a less favorable plasma lipid profile.

At present, however, few data exist to estimate the prevalence of this disease in large populations. Methods and Results As part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in (Young) Adults (CARDIA) Study, an epidemiological study of coronary risk factors, 4111 men and women 23 to 35 years of age selected from the general population of four urban centers had technically satisfactory echocardiographic studies during 1987 through 1988. Probable or definite echocardiographic evidence of HCM was present in 7 subjects (0.17%) on the basis of identification of a hypertrophied, nondilated left ventricle and maximal wall thickness greater than or equal to 15 mm that were not associated with systemic hypertension. Prevalence in men and women was 0.26:0.09%; in blacks and whites, 0.24:0.10%. Ventricular septal thickness was 15 to 21 mm (mean, 17 mm) in the 7 subjects. Only 1 of the 7 subjects had ever experienced important cardiac symptoms attributable to HCM, had previously been suspected of having cardiovascular disease, or had obstruction to left ventricular outflow; 4 other subjects had relatively mild systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve that was insufficient to produce dynamic basal outflow obstruction.

Linear regression coefficients in women were 1.07 sec to heart rate 130/ml ethanol/day in nonsmokers and 0.23 sec to heart rate 130/ml ethanol/day in smokers. Men and women who smoked showed 31 sec longer time to heart rate 130, regardless of ethanol intake, Mean daily ethanol intake was positively associated with duration of treadmill testing in women, but weakly associated with duration in men, These results show increased physical fitness as ethanol intake increased in women and nonsmoking men and mildly decreased physical fitness as ethanol consumption increases among men who smoke. The positive association of physical activity with ethanol intake among nonsmokers combined with downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in smokers may partially explain these results. Physical activity levels increase as ethanol consumption increases in nonsmokers, whereas smokers have a constant physical activity level. This alcohol-fitness relationship may change as physical activity levels decline with age or as the association of ethanol with physical activity changes.",6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0145-6008,1530-0277,ALCOHOL CLIN EXP RES,Alcoholism (NY),AUG,1995,19,4,1048,1054,,10.1111/j.1530-0277.1995.tb00987.x,7,Substance Abuse,Substance Abuse,WOS:A1995RP72100039,7485815,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent epidemiological data have suggested that M-mode echocardiographically determined LV hypertrophy is an independent predictor of mortality and morbidity from coronary heart disease (CHD) in older adults. Echocardiographic LV mass has been associated in middle-aged and older adults with multiple factors including age, arterial blood pressure, body mass, and sex. However, there are few data describing the distribution of echo LV mass among black and white young adult men and women and relating LV mass to cardiovascular disease risk factors within race-sex subgroups. Methods and Results CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) is a multicenter study of young adults, including approximately equal proportions of black and white men and women aged 23 to 35 years at the time of echo examination (1990 through 1991). Two-dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiograms were attempted in 4243 participants with recordings deemed acceptable for calculation of LV mass, that is, of at least fair quality score, obtained in 3840 (90.5% of the 1990-1991 cohort). M-mode LV mass was calculated from the formula of Devereux and Reichek, adapted for use with measurements made according to the American Society of Echocardiography Standards. LV mass was greater in men than in women and greater in blacks than in whites (P<.001) (mean+/-SD): black men, 176+/-42 g; white men, 169+/-40 g; black women, 135+/-38 g; and white women, 125+/-33 g. In all race-sex groups, LV mass was positively correlated (P<.0001) in bivariate analyses with body weight, subscapular skinfold thickness, height, and systolic blood pressure. In multivariate analyses, LV mass remained independently and positively related to body weight and systolic blood pressure and, when body weight was not considered, with subscapular skinfold thickness and height. In addition, the multivariate models allowed us to infer a direct relation between LV mass and both fatness and lean body mass. Weaker positive associations were noted of LV mass with pulse pressure in white participants and with physical activity in men. After adjustment for subscapular skinfold thickness, height, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, alcohol consumption, pulmonary function, smoking history, physical activity, total serum cholesterol, and family history of hypertension, LV mass remained higher in men than in women (P<.0001), in black men (167+/-43 g) than in white men (156+/-50 g, P<.0001), and in black women (142+/-49 g) than in white women (137+/-43 g, P<.002). Conclusions In the healthy young adults of the CARDIA cohort, LV mass was highly correlated with body weight, subscapular skinfold thickness, height, and systolic blood pressure across race and sex subgroups. Furthermore, after adjustment for anthropometric, blood pressure, and other covariates, LV mass remained higher in men than in women and in blacks than in whites. Longitudinal studies are necessary to delineate the possible roles of these factors in the genesis of LV hypertrophy.",218,AMER HEART ASSOC,DALLAS,"7272 GREENVILLE AVENUE, DALLAS, TX 75231-4596",0009-7322,,CIRCULATION,Circulation,1-Aug,1995,92,3,380,387,,10.1161/01.CIR.92.3.380,8,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,WOS:A1995RL56200019,7634452,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assessed clinical and echocardiographic measures of cardiac function at rest in smokers and nonsmokers to determine the associations of cigarette smoking with various measures of left and right ventricular performance. Background. Whereas the immediate cardiovascular effects of cigarette smoking have been well described, the long-term effects in an otherwise healthy cohort have not. Of particular interest were associations with heart rate, left ventricular end systolic stress and left ventricular mass because higher levels of these measures would suggest increased myocardial oxygen consumption. Methods. In year 5 of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, 3,366 smokers and nonsmokers (ex-smokers were excluded) underwent echocardiography as well as assessment of heart rate, anthropometric measurements and blood pressure. Participants ranged in age from 23 to 35 years and were equally distributed by race and gender, Echocardiographic measures included pulsed Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time (a decrease suggests increased pulmonary artery pressure), left ventricular mass, left ventricular end-systolic stress and left ventricular fractional shortening. Results. All comparisons were between smokers and nonsmokers. Heart rate at rest was significantly higher in smokers by 1.5 to 5 beats/min in all race/gender groups except black men. In men who smoked, pulmonary artery acceleration time was significantly lower by 4 to 8 ms, Except for black male smokers, there was a trend toward increased left ventricular mass (3 to 8 g) in all race/gender groups, significant in black women. Left ventricular end-systolic stress was significantly higher in women who smoked (4 to 6 dynes/cm(2)). There were no differences for systolic blood pressure or left ventricular fractional shortening. Conclusion. In an assessment of cardiovascular function at rest in young adults, quantifiable differences between smokers and nonsmokers that predict increased rest myocardial oxygen consumption in smokers were found. Some of these differences were gender specific.",46,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0735-1097,1558-3597,J AM COLL CARDIOL,J. Am. Coll.

This study examined the associations of left ventricular mass,vith self-reported cocaine and alcohol use prevalent in the young adult population, Background. Increased left ventricular mass has been associated with long-term use of cocaine and alcohol; however, few of the published studies have been population based. Methods. Data from 3,446 black and white participants (mean age 29.9 years) in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study were used to examine the associations between echocardiographically measured left ventricular mass obtained from 1990 to 1991 and self-reported cocaine and alcohol use, Categories of cocaine use were those who denied ever using cocaine (n = 2,122), experimental users who admitted to cocaine use only 1 to 10 times in their lifetime (n = 755) and recurrent users who admitted to cocaine use > 10 times in their lifetime (n = 568). For alcohol consumption, categories were abstainers who consistently denied any alcohol consumption in the year before each of the three CARDIA examinations (n = 275), occasional users who admitted consuming alcohol less than once a week or not at all during the year before the third examination (n = 1,322), moderate users who consumed 1 to 209 mi of alcohol/week during the year before the third examination (n 1,524) and heavy users who consumed greater than or equal to 210 mi of alcohol/week during the year before the third examination (n = 323). Estimated power to detect a 10% difference in left ventricular mass between groups was > 80%. Results. For white women, left ventricular mass was significantly higher among those who reported 1 to 10 lifetime uses of cocaine than in never-users (128.5 g [SE 2.0] vs. 122.7 g [SE 1.4], p = 0.002). There were no other significant differences in left ventricular mass among categories of cocaine or alcohol use in unadjusted analyses or among analyses controlling for age, body mass index, alcohol or cocaine use, physical activity, cigarette smoking status and systolic blood pressure.

There are few data on the distribution of resting LVEF and component volumes in healthy young adults or on any association of LVEF with coronary risk factors. LVEF and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (LVEDV and LVESV, respectively) were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography in 1782 men and women 23 to 35 years old without self-reported heart disease (other than mitral valve prolapse, n = 53) who were participants in the multicenter Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. Factors analyzed as potential contributors to LVEF, LVEDV, and LVESV included age, gender, race, blood pressure, alcohol use, current smoking, family history of myocardial infarction, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, obesity, reported physical activity, and fitness as assessed by treadmill exercise testing. LVEF was lower in men (mean 62.6%, SD 5.7%) than in women (mean 63.9%, SD 5.7%) (p < 0.01) but did not differ significantly between black and white subjects. Ninety percent of subjects had an LVEF between 53% and 71%. LVEDV and LVESV were >25% greater in men than in women. From multivariate analysis, male gender, history of hypertension, and current smoking were each positively and independently associated with an approximately 1% lower LVEF. Body surface area, a family history of premature myocardial infarction, and treadmill workload 150 time were positively related, whereas total skinfold thickness was negatively related to LVEDV and LVESV. In addition, systolic blood pressure was positively related and diastolic blood pressure and total cholesterol concentration negatively related to LVEDV, whereas treadmill performance measured in metabolic equivalents (METS) and current smoking were positively related and age negatively related to LVESV. These results suggest that LVEF in healthy young adults is maintained over a limited range and that its variability not substantially associated with coronary risk factors. Determination of whether differences in LVEF, LVESV, and LVEDV in young adults influence future cardiovascular risk and whether obesity and other factors express any effect on risk through differences in LVESV and LVEDV will require longitudinal follow-up studies.",20,MOSBY-YEAR BOOK INC,ST LOUIS,"11830 WESTLINE INDUSTRIAL DR, ST LOUIS, MO 63146-3318",0002-8703,,AM HEART J,Am.

At baseline, a diet history questionnaire developed for the CARDIA study was used; at the second exam the NCI (Block) food frequency questionnaire was used. The purpose of the present report is to compare the estimated nutrient intakes obtained with the two instruments; to compare correlations of nutrient intakes obtained at the two exams with those observed for other lifestyle and physiological variables also measured 2 years apart; and to assess ability to test hypotheses relating a-year changes in risk factors to between-exam differences in reported nutrient intakes. Mean levels of reported intake were generally greater for both blacks and whites on the CARDIA diet history than on the Block food frequency. Rank order correlations of reported nutrient intakes between the two questionnaires indicated greater consistency between instruments for whites (r's ranging between 0.35 and 0.52) than for blacks (r's ranging between 0.29 and 0.45). Correlations over time for nutrients were smaller than those observed for body size measures and lipid levels but were similar in magnitude to those for blood pressure, physical activity, and life events. At both exams, total caloric intake was positively associated with physical activity (range of r's for CARDIA were 0.07 for white women to 0.23 for black men, the range of r's for Block were 0.06 for women to 0.11 for white men). Using data from the two examinations, 2-year changes in total plasma cholesterol were significantly related to 2 year changes in Keys scores. The results of this comparison are useful in that they show similarities and differences between two instruments developed to gather dietary intake data.

The authors measured fibrinogen in 4,193 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study with three objectives: to describe fibrinogen levels in young adults, to determine if correlates of fibrinogen in older adults apply to younger adults, and to examine several additional hypothesized correlates. Fibrinogen (overall mean +/- standard deviation = 263 +/- 57 mg/dl) was greater in women than in men and in blacks than in whites; it was associated positively with cigarette smoking, body mass index, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and negatively with physical activity, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and ethanol intake. Socioeconomic stress indicators and negative personality traits hypothesized as being associated with fibrinogen, possibly through adrenergic mechanisms, proved weak correlates. Parental history of diabetes was correlated positively with fibrinogen, in part because those with a positive parental history had greater body mass. Diabetes mellitus, lipoprotein(a),left ventricular mass, and oral contraceptive use were also positively correlated with fibrinogen concentration. Thus, even in young adults, fibrinogen is associated positively with most risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Chronic smoking appears to blunt the heart rate response to exercise, so that exercise duration to submaximal heart rates is increased even though maximal performance is impaired. This may result from downloading of beta-receptors caused by smoking.

Race and sex differences in lung function have been reported even after adjustment for height; however, these differences might depend on aspects of frame size other than height. We found that within this age group height2 provided robust standardization for FVC and FEV1 for all race and sex strata of the population. Height explained approximately 40% of the variance of FVC and FEV1 in whites 30% in black women, and 20% In black men. In black men only, standardization for the combination of sitting height, leg height, elbow breadth, and biacromial diameter improved explained variance to nearly 40% for FVC and nearly 30% for FEV1. After standardization for height, FVC and FEV1 were found to be 14 to 19% higher in whites than in blacks, and in men than in women.

The CARDIA dietary history was an interviewer-administered method that included a short questionnaire regarding general dietary practices followed by a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire about typical intake of foods using the previous month as a reference for recall. For each broad category of foods, participants were questioned in detail about specific foods only if they indicated that they consumed foods from that category. Follow-up questions for selected foods concerned serving size, frequency of consumption, and common additions to these foods. Provision was made for reporting foods not found in the food frequency list. The interview took approximately 45 minutes. Cue cards prompted responses and plastic food models assisted in estimating usual amounts consumed. A precoded format standardized coding for reported items and established the detail needed for recall during the interview. Baseline nutrient analyses from the CARDIA dietary history provided estimates that agreed reasonably well with expected caloric intake for body mass index according to the age- and sex-specific Recommended Dietary Allowances, but were higher than those reported from 24-hour recalls for comparable age, sex, and race groups in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

The Physical Activity Recall questionnaire categorized all activity during the previous week, while the Physical Activity History questionnaire quantified participation in 13 specific activities during the previous year. This report compares the two questionnaires with regard to their characterization of the activity levels of the sociodemographic subgroups of the study population and their associations with known physiologic correlates of physical activity. Both questionnaires resulted in the same physical activity patterns for sex (men > women) and age (younger > older) strata. However, the mean Physical Activity History score was higher in white women than in black women, while the Physical Activity Recall scores were nearly equal. The Physical Activity History score was directly related to educational status, and the Physical Activity Recall score was inversely related to educational status. The Physical Activity History score was generally more strongly associated with physiologic variables known to be related to physical activity (e.g., treadmill test duration).

CARDIA includes black and white men and women between 18 and 30 years of age at baseline (1985-1986), recruited in Birmingham, Alabama, Chicago, Illinois, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Oakland, California. Diet was assessed by a detailed interviewer-administered diet history that measured the usual eating pattern over the past month. Possible sex, race, age, and educational differences in diet, body size, and lipids-lipoproteins were explored. Nutrient analyses indicate that the Keys score, a measure of dietary fat composition, is significantly correlated with plasma cholesterol in older (aged 25-30 years) white men (r = 0.12, p < 0.01) and older white women (r = 0.12, p < 0.001). In multiple linear regression analyses, body mass index was positively and significantly associated with total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and inversely associated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol across all race-sex groups. The Keys score was significantly associated with total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in white men and women. Education was associated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol in black and white women and white men. Education was associated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol in black and white women and white men. In these young adults, dietary fat intake and body mass index were related to blood lipids in certain subgroups. In black and white men and black women, blood cholesterol increased with age across race-sex groups independently of these covariates. In view of the many factors affecting plasma cholesterol and the limitations of the dietary history method, these cross-sectional data are useful in characterizing diet and lipid differences.
